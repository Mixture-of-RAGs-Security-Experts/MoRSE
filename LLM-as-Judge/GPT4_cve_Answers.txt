This vulnerability is also known by its nickname \"RoR mass assignment vulnerability.\" It was disclosed in January 2013 and had a critical impact on applications built with Ruby on Rails.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe vulnerability specifically affects the Active Record component of Ruby on Rails, which is used for automatically mapping data between database tables and Ruby classes. The issue stems from the framework's handling of JSON and YAML parameters, allowing attackers to craft malicious input that can bypass model attribute protections. This vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code, perform SQL injections, or even instantiate arbitrary classes, leading to potential remote code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable Rails application.\n\n### Technical Background\n\nThe root cause of CVE-2013-0156 lies in the way Ruby on Rails handles mass assignment, a feature intended to make it easier to update multiple attributes of an object at once. However, before this vulnerability was patched, Rails did not adequately restrict which attributes could be updated via mass assignment. This oversight meant an attacker could modify attributes that were not intended to be accessible, including those related to associations and nested attributes, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.\n\nFor example, if a Rails application had a model with restricted attributes (i.e., attributes not intended to be updated through web requests) without proper mass assignment protection, an attacker could craft a request that sets those attributes to arbitrary values. \n\n### Mitigation and Impact\n\nThe Rails team quickly responded to this vulnerability by releasing patched versions of the framework (3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, and 2.3.15) which included changes to the default settings to make all parameters required for mass assignment to be explicitly permitted by the developer, significantly reducing the risk of this class of vulnerability being exploited.\n\nTo mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2013-0156, developers were urged to upgrade their Ruby on Rails applications to the latest, patched version immediately. For applications where immediate upgrade was not possible, developers were advised to implement workarounds, such as using the \"attr_accessible\" and \"attr_protected\" methods to specify which attributes could or could not be mass-assigned, or disabling YAML and XML parameter parsing if those features were not needed.\n\nThe discovery and widespread attention to CVE-2013-0156 led to a broader awareness in the web development community regarding the security implications of mass assignment vulnerabilities. It prompted many developers to adopt more cautious practices when handling user input and managing object attributes, reinforcing the importance of secure coding practices and regular security auditing in web application development."}{"query": "CVE-2015-1635", "answer": "CVE-2015-1635 (also known as MS15-034) is a critical vulnerability discovered in Microsoft Windows systems, specifically within the HTTP.sys component, which is an integral part of the Internet Information Services (IIS) used for hosting websites.
