However, it lacks the specific factual details about CVE-2021-24931, such as it being related to the Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking WordPress plugin, and its exploitation through an SQL injection vulnerability. This omission makes the response somewhat correct in its general assertion about vulnerabilities but not accurate or factual in detailing CVE-2021-24931.

The response gives no information about the nature of the vulnerability, its impact, or the affected software versions, all of which are critical elements of an accurate and factual description of CVE-2014-9707.
