This vulnerability is also known by its nickname \"RoR mass assignment vulnerability.\" It was disclosed in January 2013 and had a critical impact on applications built with Ruby on Rails.### OverviewThe vulnerability specifically affects the Active Record component of Ruby on Rails, which is used for automatically mapping data between database tables and Ruby classes. The issue stems from the framework's handling of JSON and YAML parameters, allowing attackers to craft malicious input that can bypass model attribute protections. This vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code, perform SQL injections, or even instantiate arbitrary classes, leading to potential remote code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable Rails application.### Technical BackgroundThe root cause of CVE-2013-0156 lies in the way Ruby on Rails handles mass assignment, a feature intended to make it easier to update multiple attributes of an object at once. However, before this vulnerability was patched, Rails did not adequately restrict which attributes could be updated via mass assignment. This oversight meant an attacker could modify attributes that were not intended to be accessible, including those related to associations and nested attributes, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.For example, if a Rails application had a model with restricted attributes (i.e., attributes not intended to be updated through web requests) without proper mass assignment protection, an attacker could craft a request that sets those attributes to arbitrary values. ### Mitigation and ImpactThe Rails team quickly responded to this vulnerability by releasing patched versions of the framework (3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, and 2.3.15) which included changes to the default settings to make all parameters required for mass assignment to be explicitly permitted by the developer, significantly reducing the risk of this class of vulnerability being exploited.To mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2013-0156, developers were urged to upgrade their Ruby on Rails applications to the latest, patched version immediately.

This helps in preventing malicious scripts from being injected into places where they can be executed.\n\n2. **Output Encoding:** When displaying user input on web pages, ensure it's encoded so that the browser interprets it only as data, not as code.\n\n3. **Use of Content Security Policy (CSP):** A CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by allowing web page administrators to specify which sources the browser should allow to load content from.\n\nFor specific mitigation and patch information regarding CVE-2019-12518, you should refer to vendor advisories and updates from Luigi's Box or other official sources to ensure the vulnerability is properly addressed in your systems."}{"query": "CVE-2022-28381", "answer": "CVE-2022-28381 refers to a vulnerability identified in certain versions of FRRouting (FRR), an open-source routing software suite utilized in Unix and Linux operating systems. FRR provides protocol daemons for BGP, IS-IS, LDP, OSPF, PIM, and RIP, among others, making it a key piece of infrastructure in managing network routes and dynamic routing.\n\n### Details of CVE-2022-28381:\n\n**Vulnerability Type:** Buffer Overflow\n\n**Affected Versions:** FRR versions prior to 8.2 are affected by this vulnerability.\n\n**Description:** This vulnerability is a buffer overflow issue in the BGP daemon (bgpd) in FRRouting. Specifically, it arises from improper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to a stack buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Extended Message to the target router. If successful, this vulnerability could be leveraged to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected router, or potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the FRRouting process.\n\n**Impact:** The primary impacts include the possibility of executing arbitrary code on the target system or causing a denial of service (DoS) through the application crash. Due to the nature of the service (routing), an exploitation could significantly disrupt network traffic or compromise the integrity and availability of networked resources.\n\n**Mitigation and Recommendations:**\n- **Patch/Upgrade:** The primary recommendation for addressing CVE-2022-28381 is to upgrade FRRouting to version 8.2 or later, as these versions contain the necessary fixes to mitigate this vulnerability.\n- **Access Control:** Implementing proper access control lists (ACLs) and firewall rules to restrict access to the affected component, i.e., the BGP daemon, can serve as a temporary measure to mitigate exposure. It is advisable to allow only trusted nodes to establish BGP sessions.\n- **Monitoring and Auditing:** Networks employing FRR should enhance their monitoring and auditing capabilities to detect any attempt to exploit this vulnerability or anomalous BGP activity that may suggest an ongoing attack.\n\nIt is crucial for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals overseeing environments running FRR to address CVE-2022-28381 promptly to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of their networked systems and services."}{"query": "CVE-2011-3360", "answer": "CVE-2011-3360 refers to a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server, which was disclosed in 2011.
